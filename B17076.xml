         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Solon,</hi> that famous <hi>Athenian,</hi> the most renowned of the <hi>Seven Wisemen,</hi> and the Law-giver of his Countrey, in vain sought amongst his Laborious Employs, a Sanctuary against Love: His continual cares for the Glory of <hi>Athens,</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in War, and his Studies in Peace, could not protect him from the assaults of this Passion. He derived his Pedigree from <hi>Codrus,</hi> one of the First Kings of <hi>Attica:</hi> The endowments of his Mind, corresponded well with so illustrious a <hi>descent,</hi> but Fortune contributed not to the support of its splendor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euphorion,</hi> Father to this <hi>Hero,</hi> had been so bountiful of his goods, where he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served them wanting, that he had scarce left sufficient for himself. <hi>Solon</hi> who would have used the same liberality, had he been in his Fathers place, would not now permit indigency to defraud him of the practise of it; he made his Industry his Exchequer, and seeking among stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers what he could no longer find at home, was so happy in his Voyages, and his Undertakings were all so successful, that he returned to <hi>Athens</hi> with a greater Revenue then his Father had consumed. Whatever <hi>Philosophers</hi> may think fit to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204334:4"/>tell us, Riches are the main Pillars and Arches of Credit and Authority. <hi>Solon</hi> was scarce taken notice of whilst Fortune seemed to frown; he was raised to the highest charges in the Commonwealth, as soon as she began to smile. There was now an obstinate War between the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the People of <hi>Megara,</hi> about the Island <hi>Salamina,</hi> both Cities pretended its dependance on them; the <hi>Athenians</hi> founded their right on Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Philaeus</hi> and <hi>Eurisaces,</hi> Sons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jÃ x,</hi> being made Citizens of <hi>Athens,</hi> had given the Island of <hi>Salamina</hi> to that Commonwealth, in token of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments. The <hi>Megarians</hi> were powerful in Men and Money: Power is often a valuable title, and <hi>Salamina</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to them. The <hi>Athenians</hi> feared them, and believing it sweeter to live voluptuously within their Walls, then to extend their Dominions at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their Peace and Pleasure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that <hi>Salamina</hi> should be left to the <hi>Megarians. Pisistratus,</hi> one of the richest Men amongst them, encouraged them in this resolution; he aspired to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority, and judged it would be easier to reduce to obedience, People
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:204334:5"/>softned by Pleasures and Idleness, then Men grown warlike, and accustomed to fights.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Pisistratus</hi> had many great Talents to make himself be beloved, He was young, handsome, and of a sweet and flattering Spirit. <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirms, he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no recommendable quality, but that he could not confine himself to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a private Citizen. The young men and populacy, supported all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; but <hi>Solon</hi> was supported by a power that never found any thing could resist it: He had in his Travels sojourned some time in <hi>Salamina,</hi> and there fell in love with <hi>Orgina,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicles,</hi> who then governed that Island; but there was a clause in the Laws of <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> the first Lawgiver among the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> forbidding any descended from the Royal Stock, to ally themselves with any other but <hi>Athenians,</hi> or, at least, People reputed to belong to <hi>Attica. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamina</hi> must then be made one of the Members of <hi>Athens,</hi> to Authorise the Love of <hi>Solon.</hi> He summons all his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the relief of his Love, and if the faction of <hi>Pisistratus</hi> was more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, <hi>Solons</hi> had the more Authority.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:204334:5"/>It was concluded, <hi>Salamina</hi> should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and <hi>Solon</hi> was made General in the expedition. He was happy in his Success, as to the concern of his glory.</p>
               <p>The Island was subdued, the <hi>Megarians</hi> who endeavored to defend it, cut in pieces; but <hi>Orgina,</hi> the Charming <hi>Orgina,</hi> for whom the War was undertaken, could not be found in the surrendred City; her Father had conveyed her thence some days before he stood affected to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi> party, of which he had given too evident proofs. He feared the resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Conquerors, and not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Strengths able to secure him by resistance, he had by the favor of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, stole out of <hi>Salamina,</hi> with no greater a train then his Daughter, and a young Slave he loved.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Solons</hi> Philosophy was now put to the test, to support him in this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it made him seem unsensible of the Honors of his Victory, and his secret Melancholly passing for Moderation; so charmed the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they offered him the title of King; they told him, That the Glory to obey so great a Man, was preferrable to the Liberty they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. <hi>Solon</hi> accepted not their offer,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204334:6"/>for besides that, he too well loved his Countrey to see it inslaved, he could not live without <hi>Orgina;</hi> he saw not glories enough in a Crown to six his thoughts, whilst she was not there; and knowing likewise, how barren the allurements of greatness are, he made that Oration so memorable to Posterity, wherein, after having by a thousand thanks testified his acknowledgments to the People of <hi>Athens</hi> for their good will, he made it evident he should declare himself unworthy of the offer, if he should accept of the effect.</p>

               <p>This Magnanimity of <hi>Solon</hi> gained him an Authority among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> not at all inferior to the title he had refused, they obeyed his Orders like the voice of an Oracle. <hi>Pisistratus</hi> beheld his glory with envy, and as obstructive to his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious designs; but it being a principal Policy of his to win the <hi>Athenians</hi> by applause, he was one of the first to give <hi>Solon</hi> joy for the greatness of his actions; he exhibited shows to the People as a token of his congratulation, and made a magnificent Feast, where he exposed to view all his riches; a vanity usual among the Ancients, and which made up an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential part of the Treat. There was to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204334:7"/>be seen at this of <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> Vessels of Gold of an excessive weight, very rich moveables, and Stones of great price; among which, <hi>Solon</hi> observed a Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of singular Beauty, which he knew to be the same he had given to <hi>Orgina</hi> at his departure from <hi>Salamina.</hi> The sight of it moved him to the Soul, he asked <hi>Pisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi> where he got that Carbuncle; <hi>Pisistratus</hi> smiled, and replied, It was a Mystery he could not explain before so many Witnesses. This answer troubled <hi>Solon</hi> so much, that he could scarce dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it, he was impatient till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were gone, that he might clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the perplexities of his mind, and pretending some private business to stay with <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> he asked him, <hi>If he were one of those Witnesses, whom he thought unfit to hear the explanation of his mystery. You of all the World,</hi> replied <hi>Pisistratus; the mystery, in which I am concerned, is a Mystery of Love; Judge then, Whether it ought to be trusted to a conformed Philosopher whose Soul stands like a Rock against all the storms of Passion, and who is continually Preaching its impossibility. I am none of those Philosophers you speak of,</hi> said <hi>Solon,</hi> interrupting him, <hi>I reverence Wisdom,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204334:7"/>and would be truly wise, if I could; but this Wisdom consists not in a brutish fierceness: Those who describe her so, never knew her well; she was made for Man, and should be a sociable Vertue. How?</hi> replied <hi>Pisistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, If I tell you, that I am in love, and that this Carbuncle is given as a token of my Mistresses kindness; will not my Passion seem a weakness to you, or can you pardon my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? It is possible,</hi> replied <hi>Solon,</hi> whom this discourse troubled more and more, <hi>I may; there are crimes carry their excuses with them. Love is indeed of it self a great extravagance, but there may be a Mistress so perfect, that that Love may become an effect of Reason. Pisistratus</hi> had no love for <hi>Solon,</hi> and believed him as severe as he seemed to be; but it is hard for any lover to resist the occasion of speaking of what they love; and he was so extreamly delighted with the thoughts, that so famed a Wiseman approved his Passion, that he could not forbear crying out, <hi>Then a thousand thanks to love, that hath made me become the most reasonable of all Men; for never was there Woman so perfect as</hi> Orgina, <hi>nor ever was the effect of that Reason made me love her; so powerful in any Brest as in mine.</hi> That name of <hi>Orgina</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:204334:8"/>put all the Philosophy of <hi>Solon</hi> to a stand. <hi>Do you call your Mistress</hi> Orgina, said he, interrupting him. <hi>Yes,</hi> replied <hi>Pisistratus, that is the name of the person I adore: I have heard speak of her at</hi> Salamina, said <hi>Solon. She is indeed of that Island,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Pisistratus, and Daughter to</hi> Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <hi>considerable both for her Birth and Degree; her Father having been always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineable to the part of the</hi> Megariana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:204334:8"/>fearful least his countenance should betray him, he asked him in a doubtful and trembling key, <hi>If he were as much beloved, as he loved. I cannot guess I am hated,</hi> replied <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> with the briskness of a successful Lover, <hi>and you may judge it by the Carbuncle which hath been the occasion of this converse.</hi> Orgina <hi>gave it me, telling me withal, That it was the greatest token of Love could be given by the Daughter of</hi> Amphicles; <hi>and that if I knew the secret contained in it, I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that</hi> Orgina <hi>offered an obliging Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, when she intrusted me with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Relation so much increased <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>'s trouble, that grown doubtful of his power to master it, he thought it best to leave <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> and seeming to satisfie himself by faintly telling him, That <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamina</hi> was become one of the Members of <hi>Athens,</hi> and that he ought not to treat as a Slave, a Virgin whom his Countrey had adopted, he bid him adieu, but in such a disorder, as was very slenderly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the reputation he had gained. Being come to his house, he found there <hi>Thales,</hi> sirnamed the <hi>Milesian,</hi> one of the most famous Wisemen of <hi>Greece,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friend to our <hi>Athenian.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:204334:9"/>of the Island of <hi>Coos</hi> had sent him a Tripod of Gold, fished out of the Sea, near their Island, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been cast in there by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> in her return from <hi>Troy,</hi> and which by the Oracle of <hi>Pythia</hi> the Prophetess, was destined to the wisest Man of all <hi>Greece.</hi> The modest <hi>Thales</hi> not believing himself worthy that renown, resigned it to <hi>Solon;</hi> and now came to prepare him to receive the present, intended to be made him next morning. <hi>Alas,</hi> cryed <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> when he understood the occasion of his Friends journey, <hi>What a labyrinth is the Heart of Man. None, dear</hi> Thales, <hi>can find out its Mazes and Windings, those who think a Philosopher as perfect in the practise of Knowledge, as in his Precepts, would soon quit that Error, if the Eyes were as certainly the Windows of the Soul, as they are but the Mask. This Morality looks pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily from you,</hi> replied <hi>Thales, in the glorious occasion that now courts you. I applaud my self for the opinion I have conceived of your Wisdom; and I observe with much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, it is not friendship hath prepossessed me in your favor. Accept the Tripod, dear</hi> Solon, <hi>for you onely are worthy to receive it, nor can any other possess it without usurpation.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204334:9"/>Thales</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi> had contracted so strict a friendship, there could be no Vail or Hypocrisie between them. <hi>Solon</hi> had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the <hi>Milesian,</hi> the birth of a Daughter which he had in his youth, whose horoscope had told him, She should be one day fatal to her Countreys Liberty. It was by <hi>Thales</hi> Counsel she was secretly brought up in one of the Isles of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, without knowing either her birth, or the misfortune threatned her. This trust injoyned a farther, which <hi>Solon</hi> could not refuse, he discovered to his friend the true state of his heart, and not hiding any circumstances of his love, <hi>Judge,</hi> added he, <hi>if I deserve the mysterious Tripod, which the gods destined for the wisest of Men, two or three violent Passions at once triumph over my Soul; I love</hi> Orgina <hi>as much as I can love, and I hate</hi> Pisistratus <hi>as much as I can hate. I am jealous and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and in the extravagancies of my fury, know not whether I should not be transported to act the same violencies against what I love, as what I hate. Keep the Tripod, dear</hi> Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, <hi>or make a present of it to some one that is wiser then</hi> Solon. <hi>I know no one,</hi> replied <hi>Thales, that more appears so; your Laws seem to have been dictated by the gods, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:204334:10"/>is learned and instructive, you are externally calm and quiet, and have refused soveraign power, if you be not wise, who then is? Or, on what foundation shall we make judgments of Men; If it be true, that your Soul is the Whirligig of so many Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let us deplore, dear</hi> Solon, <hi>the excess of humane frailty, which hath spred it self into all Men equally, appearance onely making some difference between them. We can never teach true Wisdom, we learn onely the Art of feigning</hi> Anacharsis Byas, <hi>you, and I, we are all subject to the same failings, and the gods can onely boast perfection.</hi> Concluding therefore, that the Tripod ought to be consecrated to some divinity, they sent it to that Temple at <hi>Thebes,</hi> which the <hi>Thebans</hi> had lately built in honor of <hi>Apollo,</hi> sirnamed the <hi>Ismenian. Solon</hi> prevailed with <hi>Thales</hi> to stay some days longer in <hi>Athens,</hi> to assist him in his extremities with his wise Counsels. Whiles they were one day shut up together, and <hi>Thales</hi> diswading his friends love by all the arguments his Philosophy could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him with, a Letter was brought to <hi>Solon,</hi> left by an unknown person at his Gate, who refused to stay for an answer. <hi>Solon</hi> opened it with a concern that

                  <hi>Solon</hi> burst out into a cry of joy, at the reading of this Letter, and kissing with an extasie the so beloved name of <hi>Orgina,</hi> put <hi>Thales</hi> into a strange astonishment. <hi>Is it possible,</hi> said he to <hi>Solon, that that Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom so famous in all</hi> Greece, <hi>and with which I believed, you so liberally supplied, should sink under so weak an assault. Pray, my dear</hi> Thales, <hi>said</hi> Solon, <hi>embracing his friend, trouble not my joy by such an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable reflexion. It is no more the</hi> Solon <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated through all</hi> Greece <hi>that now speaks to you; it is a sincere friend who shows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unmasked to his friend. You would find
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:204334:11"/>all men different from what they appear, if you could see their hearts naked as I discover mine to you: And besides, my dear Friend, What do you call true Wisdom, if it be not the Art to make our selves happy? Can our felicity reside in any other thing? And is it not the impressions we seek of joy or grief, which create our pleasures, or our pains? Believe me</hi> Thales, <hi>let Men think of us what they please, it is not their Opinion creates our happiness, it is the natural motions of our own Souls. In vain would all</hi> Greece <hi>believe you happy, if you believe it not your self, and others judgments of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness you found not, would but increase your misery and sorrow.</hi> Ending these words, he hasted to <hi>Pisistratus</hi> House resolved to see <hi>Orgina,</hi> if the could possibly, but she was not there to be found. <hi>Pisistratus</hi> had surprised the Letter Carrier, as he came to return an account of his Commission; and though the seeming austerity of <hi>Solon</hi> might create a dead repose in his Rival, <hi>Pisistratus</hi> who was born suspitious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving he could not be too watchful of a treasure he feared to lose, had carried away the young <hi>Orgina</hi> and her Slave, to a Countrey-house of his, two days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Athens.</hi> This news afflicted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:204334:11"/>
                  <hi>Solon</hi> as much as can be imagined, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served two or three circumstances equally vexatious, he would not for his life that his weakness should grow publick. The sudden departure of <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> and that just at the instant he received <hi>Orgina</hi>'s Letter, made him conjecture something of the truth; and if he were apprehensive of his glory, he was no less of his love; he saw his Mistress carried away, and in the power of a lover, whom he believed jealous, such a Man as <hi>Solon</hi> seldom fears without seeking a remedy; and People who are in power ever mix the greatest Interests with their own. He had begun the establishment of the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> a Counsel of great authority in <hi>Athens,</hi> and whose Decrees have made it since famous; he labored in the accomplishment of this Work, and declaring to the Assembly, that he had notice, that some <hi>Athenians</hi> held some of the Inhabitants of <hi>Salamina</hi> in a kind of slavery; he represented it as a thing ignoble, for <hi>Athens</hi> to permit, that people by her adopted should be reduced to servitude. This Remonstrance was thought just, a Decree was issued out against those which held any of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Salamina,</hi> commanding their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204334:12"/>release in three days, on pain of death. <hi>Pisistratus</hi> being the onely Man aimed at in this Decree, <hi>Solon</hi> took care to give him the first notice.</p>
               <p>In vain had they imposed the Penalty of Death on the Disobeyers, <hi>Pisistratus</hi> would have suffered a thousand deaths, ere run the hazard of losing <hi>Orgina,</hi> he secures himself with her in the Kingdom of <hi>Argos;</hi> and those who had Commission from the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> to make him give obedience to the Decree, found onely on his House, the Slave of <hi>Amphicles. Solon</hi> grew even desperate at this new misfortune. <hi>See now,</hi> said he, <hi>to</hi> Thales, <hi>how much all your boasted Wisdom contributes to our Happiness, had it not been for that Reputation of wise Man, I so little deserve, I would have forced my Mistress out of my Rivals Arms; she was mine before he knew her, her Letter assures me, I have lost no right in her; and I have a power in</hi> Athens, <hi>to which, that of</hi> Pisistratus <hi>must have been constrained to yield: And yet because I pass for a wise Man, and must pay wondrous Caution to that Title, I am robbed of</hi> Orgina, <hi>and my rival peaceably possesses her.</hi> He would needs see <hi>Amphicles</hi> his Slave, to drow from her some little satisfaction, she was brought to him,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:204334:12"/>but, O Gods! What was his astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he knew her for the same <hi>Orgina,</hi> he believed to be in the Kingdom of <hi>Argos</hi> with <hi>Pisistratus;</hi> he wanted the charitable advice of his friend <hi>Thales</hi> to withhold him from proclaiming the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his Soul to all the World. <hi>We are not now alone</hi> Solon, said the <hi>Milesian</hi> in his ear, <hi>recal that Wisdom is ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake you, and believe that</hi> Solon <hi>is too much obliged to the opinions the</hi> Athenians <hi>have conceived of him, thus at once by his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to convince them of Error. Solon</hi> strove hard to recollect himself, and appear what he was thought, and receiving <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina</hi> with that gravity, his heart approved not, he got rid of the company in the most unconcerned manner he could; but after he thought himself at liberty to return to himself, and love, and beheld, after having believed his <hi>Orgina</hi> lost, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone with her, What said he not? or, what did he not do? to pay his love those Rites Philosophy would have rob'd it of. The love of those who make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Wisdom is much more ardent then that of ordinary Lovers; it is not dispelled by any exterior ceremony, but as it reserves it self inward and intire for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:204334:13"/>great occasions, so it ordinarily breaks forth to advantage. <hi>I know,</hi> said <hi>Solon</hi> to <hi>Orgina,</hi> Pisistratus <hi>believed himself ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of your love; yet I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had reason to believe it. But</hi> Orgina <hi>I conjure you tell me he had none. I have so great a confidence in what you say, that your words should make me give my very eyes the lie, therefore tell me, nothing may make me less happy; for why should you declare your self guilty, when I will believe you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, if you will but say you are so. I thank you Sir for your confidence,</hi> replied <hi>Orgina, it is of all your qualities what I shall make the least use, a Mistress should not be believed but upon unreproachable testimony, and a Love so confiding, has a Face of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference; Believe me to be with</hi> Pisistratus <hi>in</hi> Argos, <hi>till such time as you are well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that be mistakes my Fathers Slave for me, and that by the help of that disguise I am preserved wholly for</hi> Solon. How cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Solon</hi> in an extasie, <hi>Is it your Slave then</hi> Pisistratus <hi>hath carried to</hi> Argos, <hi>and is it you he hath always thought the Slave of</hi> Amphicles. <hi>Yes Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Orgina, my Father made use of this precaution, the better to preserve me in the dangers of our flight; he believed he might more easily conceal me
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:204334:13"/>as a simple Slave, then as his Daughter; the person he chose to supply my place, is young, handsome, and vertuous.</hi> Pisistratus <hi>easily believed her what she appeared, and I thought it a just debt to the merit of that fair Maid, not to hinder her Marriage with one of the cheifest Men of</hi> Athens; <hi>the adventure of the Carbuncle was innocently contrived to give you notice of the place where I was. But Sir, methinks you believe me very easily, the quiet and tranquility of your mind has gained head, since I have been out of your sight, you are neither jealous nor suspitious. Can one be a Lover indeed, without these qualities. Solon</hi> relieved <hi>Orgina</hi> from the fears of these nice apprehensions, by making to her protestations, never learn'd in the Schools of Wisdom, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to hasten the hour of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by advancing the publication of those Laws, might permit him to marry a <hi>Salaminian,</hi> he finished that great and painful work: But to let <hi>Orgina</hi> see, that he dedicated not himself so absolutely to the service of the State, but he still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served his Heart to his Love; the same day that he engraved his serious Laws and Policies on those Tables, whereon they were to be presented to the People,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:204334:14"/>he made particular ones for his Mistress; of which, see here some Articles.</p>

               <p>As he finished this Gallantry, <hi>Thales</hi> entred his Chamber, <hi>I return to</hi> Miletum, Solon, said he, <hi>I have so journed but too long at</hi> Athens, <hi>you shall, I hope, never see me more; and therefore before I depart, I thought fit to tell you that your Daughter is lost, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates who were coursing for Booty about the</hi> Aegaean <hi>Isles, hoping her beauty might make her prize considerable, took her away, without ever since being heard of. I came hither to tell you this misforture, rather then to speak to you of the Tripod; but I found you so weak, that I thought to attempt the reducing you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:204334:16"/>to the Estate of Wisdom, before I put you to this tryal. I now find you are perverted for ever, and therefore I do, what I hoped in vain to do more to the purpose another time. Solon</hi> was so surprised at this news, and the manner in which his friend told it him, that he had not the power to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him; but having had time to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself whilst he discoursed; <hi>Is it</hi> Thales, said he, <hi>that tells</hi> Solon <hi>one of the greatest misfortunes could possibly happen to him, without appearing himself concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have been too much concerned for you,</hi> replied <hi>Thales, nor should I, had I not been sensible of your misfortunes, have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed converse with a Man in love. I should have deserted you, when I found you deserted that Wisdom first united us: That friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship I had for you, made me renounce my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity for your relief; I have staid with you, have endured to hear you talk of your Passion; and wretch, that I am, there wants but little that your disease is become contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I looked the other day upon your</hi> Orgina, <hi>with an intention, I never had for any thing but my Books: I cannot banish from my memory the bewitching</hi> Idea <hi>that object left there, I find a kind of indulgence for your weakness; it delights me as much as it terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:204334:15"/>
                  <hi>fied me before; and even the confused vapors of Sleep, conspire to the breach of my quiet.</hi> Athens, <hi>pernicious</hi> Athens, <hi>thou shalt never see</hi> Thales <hi>more, the distemper he hath begun to contract in thee, cannot be cured, but by his flight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so finishing those words, <hi>Thales</hi> went out of the Closet, and without more delay hired a passage for <hi>Miletum,</hi> not suffering the Prayers of Distress of <hi>Solon,</hi> to stay him a minute lognger. After this so unexpected parting, <hi>Solon</hi> went to see <hi>Orgina,</hi> to acquaint her with what had hapned to him. <hi>The Gods had too much favored me,</hi> said he, <hi>in restoring my</hi> Orgina <hi>to me. If they had likewise preserved to me my Doughter, and my Friend, I should have forgot my self in such height of Happiness; and some great misforture was necessary to ballance the joy I had in your recovery. But, then let my dear</hi> Orgina, <hi>be all things to me, since in finding her, I lose all things. Orgina</hi> received that obliging request, as she ought to do it, she made new Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Love and Fidelity to <hi>Solon,</hi> she endeavored to apply comfort to those misfortunes he already suffered under; and to gain from him the knowledge of those he feared for the future, she heard
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204334:15"/>him relate all the particulars of the Birth and Horoscope of his Daughter; but when in one part of the story she heard him call his Daughter <hi>Hypparete.</hi> Hyppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete, <hi>Sir,</hi> said she with a nimble hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>Yes,</hi> replied <hi>Solon, so was my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter called; and Sir</hi> (continued <hi>Orgina</hi>) <hi>of what age, of what stature, and what form of countenance, as near as you can guess was this</hi> Hypparete. <hi>She is of middle stature,</hi> replied <hi>Solon, slender, fair complexioned, bright haired, her nose aquiline, black-eyed, and particularly remarkable for a Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flie, Nature took pleasure to imprint on one of her hands, whence I took the Etymology of that name of</hi> Hypparete, <hi>which I gave her. Ah Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Orgina, seek not for</hi> Hypparete <hi>among Pyrates, she is in the hands of one of your own Citizens: It is that same Slave my Father bought some time before our departure from</hi> Salamina, <hi>who passed for me during, the time of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; and whom,</hi> Pisistratus, <hi>at present, keeps in the Kingdom of</hi> Argos. This news was very unwelcome to <hi>Solon,</hi> he loved his Countrey, as may be judged by his own refusing the Dominion over it, he knew the ambitious humor of <hi>Pisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus,</hi> and his flight from <hi>Athens</hi> having angred the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> they had issued a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:204334:17"/>Decree against his body and Goods. This rigor furnished him with a pretence to Enterprises, and the Fortune of <hi>Hyppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete</hi> assured their success. Our Law-giver was so afflicted with the misfortunes his foresight denounced, that he could not resolve to stay and be a witness to them; he banished himself willingly from <hi>Athens,</hi> and took that long voyage through all the Realms of <hi>Greece,</hi> which his advice to <hi>Creasus</hi> made so memorable. Those private Authors from whence I extracted this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, have not told me whether <hi>Orgina</hi> followed <hi>Solon.</hi> I will believe for the glory of the wise Man, that his Folly reached not so far; it is enough that he loved, and that his love was the innocent cause of the enthralment of his Courtrey. I would likewise be perswaded that he married the Daughter of <hi>Amphicles,</hi> but when we come to think his Mistress his Wife, we cannot well think she staid behind at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Solons</hi> Predictions had a full effect, <hi>Pisistratus</hi> subjected his Countrey, and reigned peaceably the rest of his days. Let us now search, if this same City, so famous among the Ancients, and so fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in great Men, cannot furnish us with other Examples to employ some pleasant hours.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is not of absolute necessity for that Man to be handsome, who designes to make <hi>Love.</hi> The best Descriptions the World has given us of <hi>Socrates</hi> containe little answerable to the qualities of a <hi>Lover.</hi> He was neither of a Courtly Humour, nor of taking Shape of Feature. He made Profession of an <hi>Austere Philosophy,</hi> and yet for all this he was in <hi>Love:</hi> But, as <hi>Love</hi> knows how to change his shape,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:204334:18"/>and put on what disguise he pleases; it was not under his ordinary figure he crept into the Soul of <hi>Socrates,</hi> but under the Image of <hi>Virtue. Timandra</hi> a young <hi>Phrygian</hi> Lady, famous to Posterity for the adventures we are about to relate, was Daughter to one of <hi>Socrates</hi> his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends. Some private reasons having obliged this Gentleman to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Athens,</hi> he dies, and valuing <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> his Friendship equal to himself, trusts to his care his only Daughter, a charge which the <hi>Philosopher</hi> accepts with joy and generosity. This Lady was very fair, and <hi>Socrates</hi> discerned in her such sparkes of wit and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as he hoped might be one day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into hands of Wisdom: He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to make her a <hi>Philosophical</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and, prudently judging that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with the World might obstruct his design, he committed <hi>Timandra</hi> to the cares of <hi>Aglaonice</hi> the <hi>Astrologess,</hi> who, under the pretence of making her <hi>Celestial Observations,</hi> lived in an extreame Solitude. <hi>Socrates</hi> charmed with the good dispositions he found in the Soul of <hi>Timandra,</hi> would spend whole dayes in forming her Manners after the Rules
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:204334:18"/>of Vertue: <hi>For what reason</hi> (would he say to her) <hi>think you, the gods have made you be borne so accomplished? 'Tis neither out of any singular love to your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor out of any hate to other Women, made less perfect; but, 'tis to manifest in you the power of the qualities of the Soul above those of the Body: had you had but an ordinary Beauty, the assaults made on your Virtue would have been so feeble, your Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would not become an Example: but now, when in the fairest Lady of all</hi> Greece <hi>there shall be observed a Soul impregnable against all the assaults of Passion, a laudable disdain of perishable and transitory pleasures, and solid love, for those can never wast; you will become a Living Axiome, which all the Arguments of our</hi> Libertines <hi>shall not have the boldness to insult over.</hi> These Arguments, which one would have thought should only have alarm'd the Gallant, gave yet the Alarme to Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Love, and beat up a Charge to his Spouse <hi>Myrto, Socrates</hi> Wife, who, for all her being Daughter to <hi>Aristides,</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the Just, was not her self the more so, observed some trouble in her Husband, when he saw not <hi>Timandra,</hi> and discovering, he paid his Visits to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:204334:19"/>that Lady when ever he could get from her, conceived a furious Jealousie. This Woman seemed to have been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen out by Heaven to keep the Virtue of <hi>Socrates</hi> in breath. Never was there VVife more untractable; and, because the had kept her honour untainted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shelter of little temptations, she became a merciless Tyrant, exacting tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Patience from those least ought to pay it; She aspersed <hi>Timandra</hi> with all the Titles her Jealousie could dictate: <hi>But</hi> Myrto, (said Socrates to her) <hi>Is it from your own experience you judge so ill of the vertue of your Sex? We should seldome suspect failings in others, of which our selves are not, or have not a will to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Do you think the Gods have favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with a peculiar priviledge? or whilst you would have them believed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of Chastity to you, is it to be presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that they are niggards to all other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? I know not what to answer to these</hi> Sophistryes (said <hi>Myrto</hi> interrupting him) <hi>I read no Book but my Prayers, and would scarce be well pleased with any other; but these frequent meetings and interviews between different Sexes are neither lawful nor honest, there is alwayes in them some
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:204334:19"/>mixtures of Criminal designs; and, as one of your Schollars said well some dayes since, Men and Women were only sent into the World to propagate. Your memory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> (said <hi>Socrates</hi> very coldly) <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pretty passages of my schollars lessons, I have no design</hi> Timandra <hi>should grow so learned, and the</hi> Philosophy <hi>I teach her has Precepts utterly opposite to those you are pleased to remember. See, see, what a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty excuse you have found</hi> (said his Wife interrupting him) <hi>Love never wants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; had you been a</hi> Painter <hi>you would have feigned to teach that art to</hi> Timan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra, <hi>now, being a</hi> Philosopher, <hi>you would by all means teach her to</hi> Philosophize; <hi>but</hi> Socrates, <hi>those who would give Lessons of</hi> Modesty <hi>and</hi> Virtue, <hi>make not choice of</hi> Schollars <hi>so young and so handsome.</hi> This Dispute was interrupted by the coming in of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> the bravest and most Courtly of all the <hi>Greacians;</hi> whose inclinations, though unconformable with the severity of <hi>Socrates,</hi> impeded not a strict friendship between them; The <hi>Philosopher</hi> made a Sign to his Wife to be quiet when he perceived <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> whom he would not have know <hi>Timandra:</hi> People so spritely and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:204334:20"/>as this Illustrious <hi>Athenian,</hi> often reap what <hi>Philosophy</hi> has sown; but <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> who was in a talking humour, would not stop for all her Husbands Signes; she appealed to <hi>Alcibiades</hi> whether her Suspicions were not just and reasonable; and, enflamed with <hi>socrates</hi> his oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and endeavours to hinder her being heard, exposed the whole pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue of her Husband with the faire <hi>Phrygian</hi> as an incontestable truth, when want of breath made her silently retire. <hi>Do you then impose on us at this rate</hi> (said <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to his Friend) <hi>or can you think we will be thus deceiv'd? you are continually Preaching to us contempt of the Passions, my Age and other Engagements can gaine no indulgence from you; yet, as if you spent your whole stock of</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy <hi>in Counsel to your Friends, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main your self unprovided. Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an angry Woman</hi> (replyed <hi>Socrates</hi> coldly) <hi>these are visions of her Jealous Fancy, which have neither likelihood nor foundation. How</hi> (said <hi>Alcibiades</hi>) <hi>is it not true then you have that affection for this</hi> Timandra, <hi>at which your Wife appeares so alarm'd at. I acknowledge</hi> (replyed <hi>Socrates</hi>) <hi>I have delighted to Cultivate and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:204334:20"/>improve an excellent good Nature, which Chance offered to my Cares, and which all the considerations of Friendship oblige me not to see lie fallow; And, this excellent good Nature,</hi> (said <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him) <hi>is seated in a fair and youthful person; What is that Circumstance to our purpose</hi> (replyed the <hi>Philosopher</hi> in a some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what an angry tome) <hi>or, What communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation can there be between the Beauty of a Woman, and the Soul of</hi> Socrates? <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> was now returned from his first Exile, and had had some experience in Love; <hi>I talked like you</hi> (replyed he) <hi>when I was admonished against the charmes of</hi> Namea; <hi>How! would I say to my self, can</hi> Alcibiades, <hi>whom the chiefest Ladies of</hi> Athens <hi>are proud to favour, and whom a great Queen did not disdaine, love a Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san: I will see her, and if my heart can find leasure to cast off nobler Passions, Court her perhaps for some few houres; but, this light distraction cannot be called Love, nor is</hi> Nemea <hi>of a quality considerable enough to give it me; this was once my Song, and yet</hi> Socrates <hi>you Know whither this Love hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, to what Censure I exposed my self by it; and, into what dangers it led my am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. Your soul and mine are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:204334:21"/>said</hi> Socrates <hi>your Riches continually sollicite your delights; you are softned by pleasures irreparably attending your degree, and finding your self alwayes in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to attempt reliefe, you may desire all things; for my part, the meanness of my fortunes secure my rest and quiet; I regard Beauty but as an effect of Nature, which teaches me the knowledge of its cause; and finding matter to exercise my Virtue in that which debauches yours, from that wreck I learn to keep my self in the Port. Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> said many other things to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi> to oblige him not to have such stedfast considence in his <hi>Philosophy,</hi> but he could not shake the opinion <hi>Socrates</hi> had of its fortitude. Though he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Timandra</hi> to be worthy of love, yet he would not grant <hi>Socrates</hi> to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Loving. But, the testimony he had given of the merit of the faire <hi>Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> stir'd up a curiosity in <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> to see if <hi>Socrates</hi> were as well skill'd in his distinctions of <hi>Beauty</hi> as <hi>Philosophy;</hi> he had observed by their discourse the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi> was covetous of his Treasure, he believed if he would have a sight of it, it must be by stealth, he therefore cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Socrates</hi> to be watcht, to find out <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandra</hi>'s
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:204334:21"/>House; and, having discover'd it, he Apparelled himself like a <hi>Phrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and making choice of a day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he knew the <hi>Philosopher</hi> imploy'd in giving publick Lessons to his Schollers, he presents himself at <hi>Timandra</hi>'s Gate, pretending himself a <hi>Phrigian,</hi> come to bring her Newes from her Countrey; he spoke very well all Languages in use in his time; and, among other admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities which graced him, he had a most excellent way of acting all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises: But, <hi>Socrates</hi> had given such Orders at <hi>Aglaonice</hi>'s, as were proofe against all occasions and all artifices. The <hi>Astrologess</hi> came in the place of the <hi>Phrigian,</hi> and her person being ill favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and displeasing, as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> hoped to find it beautiful and charming, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated two or three paces at sight of her, and much surprized, asked her, <hi>If she were</hi> Socrates <hi>his Scholler? Yes, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Aglaonice (who had reasons for that untruth) <hi>What have you to say to me, or what are your affaires? Nay, nothing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> (reply'd <hi>Alcibiades</hi> very coldly) <hi>I had many things to say to</hi> Timandra <hi>when I came into this house, but having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got them all, have now nothing to say, but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:204334:22"/>take my leave. Alcibiades</hi> had a mighty winning way both in his carriage and converse, which subdu'd the hearts of all that saw him. The <hi>Astrologess</hi> was smitten as with an Arrow, and unable to submit to the loss of an object so soon known dear to her: <hi>I see you are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what startled</hi> (said she to the supposed <hi>Phrigian</hi>) <hi>you have doubtless heard Me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd fairer then you find me; but Sir,</hi> (added she, presenting her hand to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi>) <hi>I will let you see with what kind of beauty the great</hi> Socrates <hi>is affected;</hi> and at that word she led the Illustrious <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> into a Closet set out with <hi>Globes</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> and showing him a Scheame which lay on the Table, <hi>See there</hi> (said she) <hi>what deserves more admiration then all the fraile Beauties Nature can show us; that Scheame containes the destiny of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Empires; I read in the Stars all that happens memorable upon Earth; and, have more knowledge of things to come then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary persons have of things present: I alone have secured</hi> Socrates <hi>against the fears he had of the Illustrious</hi> Alcibiades. <hi>Do you then know</hi> Alcibiades (said the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Phrigian</hi> interrupting her.) <hi>Aglaonice</hi> gave a disdainful smile at that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:204334:22"/>demand, and affecting a certain tone of a woman well satisfy'd with her skill; <hi>Is there any thing in the world I would know, and do not</hi> (replyed she) <hi>I learn'd from</hi> Socrates <hi>the houre of</hi> Alcibiades'<hi>s Birth, and have Calculated his Nativity; see there,</hi> said she, drawing it out from many other Papers, <hi>the directions and revolutions, and by this I dare boast to know all that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to him as well as himself. How,</hi> said <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> interrupting her, <hi>Does your knowledge teach event to his indifferent actions? I know even his indifferent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> reply'd <hi>Aglaonice, which includes all, not excepting any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I did not believe,</hi> pursu'd <hi>Alcibiades</hi> smiling, <hi>that</hi> Astrology <hi>entered into the search of trivial things; I know well there may be drawn from the influence of the Stars a judgement upon the inclination and the temper; I will likewise believe the life of Man may be subject to Revolutions, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing enough to be worth Heavens notice, but that you can tell what</hi> Alcibiades <hi>is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this very minute I speak, is what you will hardly perswade me to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You know not what I can do, said</hi> Aglao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, <hi>People who judge things but in gross, have onely penetrated into a superficial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:204334:23"/>of the Stars; I have made my searches farther, and when I erect a Figure for any one, I can, if need be, give an account of the very number of his words. Pray Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> said the supposed <hi>Phrygian, favour me with a proof of this rare knowledge in the person of</hi> Alcibiades; <hi>I knew him in</hi> Phrigia, <hi>have an honour for him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to go seek him when I go hence; I shall make proof of what you tell me, and it will be no small conversion, if you can make me a Proselyte to Astrology. Aglaonice</hi> well pleased with the opportunity of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still with her the lovely <hi>Phrigian,</hi> searches her Books, and after a long confronting of the <hi>Signes</hi> and <hi>Planets, Are you discreet,</hi> said she, <hi>to the disguis'd</hi> Athenian? <hi>Yes, without doubt,</hi> replyed he; <hi>and, for your better assurance, one of the best Friends</hi> Alcibiades <hi>ever had: He is then,</hi> said she, inclining her head to whisper it in his eare, <hi>at present making Courtship to one of the fairest Ladies of</hi> Athens, <hi>whom he loves, and by whom he is as ardently beloved: Alcibiades</hi> could not forbear bursting out into Laughter at the result of this Observation, and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologess</hi> being half put out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; <hi>I believe,</hi> said she, <hi>you doubt of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:204334:23"/>what I have told you: Pardon me; Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Alcibiades, you could not hit any thing righter, I have such visible proofes of the certainty of your Science, that I will go admonish</hi> Alcibiades <hi>to be more cautious for the future; for, since all he does is so perfectly known, he ought to do nothing which he feares should grow pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi> With this Irony <hi>Alcibiades</hi> took his leave, leaving the <hi>Astrologess</hi> more taken with the Charmes of the <hi>Phrygian,</hi> then he was ill satisfied with the ugliness of the false <hi>Timandra;</hi> he had gone but few steps from thence when he was met by <hi>Socrates:</hi> That <hi>Philosopher</hi> made his publick Lessons very short, having more pleasing private ones to give elsewhere; he cast a sower look at his Friend when he saw him disguis'd in that manner, and not doubting but Love had a part in the Metamorphosis, he was preparing to make him one of those Remonstrances wherewith he used to Declaime against Voluptuousness: But <hi>Alcibiades</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting him; <hi>I guess all you would say, dear</hi> Socrates, said he, <hi>I confess I am in an error, and that you have reason to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid me, but I am punish'd enough by my own curiosity, and by the displeasure it gave
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:204334:24"/>me, I shall never hereafter be so vain, and if I could have suspected you of so gross a discernement, your</hi> Timandra <hi>had not cost me the trouble of a disguise.</hi> At that word he parted, not being in humour to hear <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Morallo.</hi> And, the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> more troubled at what he had heard, then at all the accidents of his life, hastned the small remainder of his way to <hi>Aglaonice</hi>'s, whom asking for at entrance, and understanding she was in the Garden, he posts to her to upbraid, her negligence. <hi>You have promised me</hi> (said he chafing) <hi>that you would not let</hi> Timandra <hi>be seen by any other Man i'th' world; It was agreed you should receive the Compliments addressed to her, that we might better order all our Measures for the defeating the Snares and Stratagems of the Curious, and yet</hi> Aglaonice, <hi>you whom I believed a woman of extraordinary trust, and to whose charge I have committed the person in whom I had placed all my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, betray this confidence, and your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, in favour of</hi> Alcibiades. <hi>I,</hi> cryed out the <hi>Astrologess, I let</hi> Alcibiades <hi>see</hi> Timandra; <hi>From whom have you this false Story? 'Tis too much a truth,</hi> replyed Socrates, <hi>I have it from</hi> Alcibiades <hi>own
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:204334:24"/>mouth, whom I met not ten steps off, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised like a</hi> Phrigian, <hi>and, who told me, he came from</hi> Timandra. <hi>If it were</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades, continued <hi>Aglaonice, came to aske for</hi> Timandra <hi>in the</hi> Phrigian <hi>habit, forbear to trouble your self, 'twas I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Visit, and 'tis me he takes for your young</hi> Phrigian: Whereupon she rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him all the passages of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view between her and the supposed <hi>Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian,</hi> making him almost break his Spleen with Laughing at the fallacies of her Science, and the surprize wherein she represented <hi>Alcibiades. Timandra</hi>'s Closet windows answer'd directly to the place where this Conversation was held, so that she lost not one word of it; and, discontented with the Captivity of her Condition, designes a revenge by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Alcibiades;</hi> To this purpose she Bribes one of <hi>Aglaonice</hi>'s Houshold Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and entrusting him with a <hi>Letter</hi> for the Illustrious <hi>Athenian,</hi> makes him promise to deliver it to his own hand. The Porter, who understood well what he had to do, and fear'd not a liberal payment for the delivery of a <hi>Letter</hi> from so fair a Lady to the gallant and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> chose the hour he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:204334:25"/>most convenient to acquit himself of his Commission, but was unhappily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by a former Messenger, who had put <hi>Alcibiades</hi> into a scurvy disorder of minde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aglaonice,</hi> who, according to the Mode of ignorant <hi>Astrologers,</hi> found still in the <hi>Stars</hi> what pleased her self, rather then what they denounced, was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> Ascendant and her own Leer'd at one another with a kind of Sympathetical Aspect; she would have Sworn by the faith of her Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that he was necessitated by an over-ruling influence to love her; and, believing she ought to press forward so happy a destiny, by some kind exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions she had entrusted an Apprentice in <hi>Astrology,</hi> who daily came to honour her with his meaner offerings, to give <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in the behalf of the young <hi>Phrigian</hi> Lady, the following <hi>Epistle.</hi>

               <p>An hour after the Messenger of <hi>Aglao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> was dispatched, <hi>Timandra</hi>'s came to present her Letter, and demand the like expedition. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> believed it was a second Epistle of the Nature of the first, he had too many pleasant intrigues upon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:204334:26"/>his hands, to spare time for a commerce so nauseous and troublesome. <hi>You may tell</hi> Timandra, said he, <hi>refusing to receive the Letter she sent him, that I guess what her Letter contains, and that my engagements with</hi> Socrates <hi>permit me not to have any with her; and therefore I desire her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear these kindnesses for ever.</hi> These ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible words being brought to <hi>Timandra,</hi> she received with such an anger mixed with shame, as made her easily resolve on the Silence imposed. But <hi>Aglaonice</hi> not so easily offended, and whose skill promised her more happy success in her enterprise, would not be repulsed for one difficulty; she assassinated <hi>Alcibiades</hi> with Astrological menaces, he could never come home without finding some note or other from the false <hi>Timandra;</hi> they were strewed upon his Table, and in his Closet, as if they had been his daily <hi>Agenda,</hi> he resolved to stop this current. He was naturally kind and civil, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to avoid all occasions of rudeness towards a Sex he adored; but these fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Messages from a Woman, might prejudice him in some other affairs, he writ to the Astrologess in terms admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no Answer; and that she might not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:204334:26"/>feign the miscarriage of his Letter he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted his Nurse with the delivery. She was a very notable Woman, called <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla,</hi> and a <hi>Lacedemonian;</hi> but the Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of <hi>Sparta,</hi> could not secure her from some flyings out of Blood and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. She takes out of <hi>Alcibiades</hi>'s Closet Petrified Plants, several Sea Animals dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and becoming a Merchant of this sort of traffick, she goes and asks at <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandra</hi>'s Gate, if they would buy any of her Curiosities. The fair <hi>Phrygian</hi> was alone contrary to her Custom, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> was retired for some days to a house out of <hi>Athens,</hi> where he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to maintain a publick dispute, and <hi>Aglaonice</hi> weakned with the watchings, and agonies of Love, did that day keep her bed, <hi>Timandra</hi> would needs see <hi>Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla</hi>'s rarities, and she set them forth with all the terms and tattle requisite in the person, she played, and following the <hi>Phrygian</hi> to a Window, where she was looking on a petrified Fruit, slipping the Letter into her hand, <hi>See there Madam,</hi> said she, <hi>the rarest piece of all my Shop,</hi> Alcibiades <hi>sends it you.</hi> The <hi>Phrygian</hi> blusht at that name, and opening her hand, that she might not receive what
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204334:27"/>was offered her. <hi>You may tell</hi> Alcibiades, said she to the counterfeit Merchant, <hi>that I guess what the Letter contains, and that my engagements with</hi> Socrates <hi>permit me not to have any with him.</hi> At which words she stept into her Closet, leaving the poor Nurse much afflicted at the ill success of her negotiation, she returns forthwith to <hi>Alcibiades. Your business goes ill Sir,</hi> said she, <hi>I presented your Letter with all the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you could expect from me, but</hi> Timan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra <hi>would not receive it; she sends you word, that she guesses what it contains, and that her engagements with</hi> Socrates <hi>permit her not to have any with you. Alcibiades</hi> burst out with laughing at the repetition of the same words, he remembred to have sent formerly to her. <hi>How!</hi> cryed he, <hi>and am I become displeasing even to</hi> Timan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra, <hi>Destiny is my friend, and I ow it a Sacrifice of Thanks; Lord Sir,</hi> cryed <hi>Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla,</hi> much surprised, <hi>I thought I brought your deaths wound, when I told you that a person of such Heavenly Beauty would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your addresses. Amycla</hi> had art, and would droll very pleasantly, and <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi> often delighted to hear her, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved she had a mind now to divert him as she used. <hi>Indeed,</hi> says he ironically,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:204334:27"/>Timandra <hi>is a very Heavenly Beauty, that staring ghastly air which in her Face, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the disorders of her Mind; that ill shaped Carcass; that constrained Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that leaness brought upon her by her Chimerical Studies, are all moving Reasons of Dispair in a Man not beloved. What say you of leanness, ill shape, or ghast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Countenance,</hi> said <hi>Amycla</hi> interrupting him, <hi>I could find no such thing in the young</hi> Timandra, <hi>she is as beautiful in Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as well shaped in Body; her Ways and Manners are obliging; nor know I a Beauty in</hi> Athens <hi>can be justly compared to her. Alcibiades</hi> could not reconcile this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with what his eyes had seen; and therefore conjures his Nurse to be seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unravel the Intrigue. <hi>Amycla</hi> returns to <hi>Timandra,</hi> and feigning to have lost something, desires to speak with her, to know if she had found it. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandra</hi> mistrusting some new Message from <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> which her anger for the old repulse, would not now let her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, goes into <hi>Aglaonices</hi>'s Chamber, to give Audience to <hi>Amycla. Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi>'s Nurse found in the Astrologess, what he believ'd to have found in the <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian,</hi> and running presently to tell him the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:204334:28"/>truth, threw him into a Melancholly not easily represented; his Natural admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for fair Ladies amounted even to Idolatry, and he could not without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, consider he had given such a one occasion to be angry with him, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores the assistance of <hi>Amycla:</hi> She ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices him to return some shews of love to <hi>Aglaonice,</hi> thereby to get opportunity of seeing <hi>Timandra,</hi> and undertaking to manage the affair, goes forthwith from him to <hi>Aglaonice;</hi> and tells her the indifference practised and affected by <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> was but a cunning to make tryal of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness she professed, which her perseverance having confirmed, he was ready to be at her service; that he knew well the Stars presided in affairs of Love, and that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting without murmur to their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, she might dispose of his destiny, as its absolute Mistress. <hi>Aglaonice</hi> was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy at this complement of <hi>Amyclaes;</hi> she requited the happy news with the gift of a rich Ring from her Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and the absence of <hi>Socrates</hi> giving him fair opportunity to make his visits; <hi>Alcibiades</hi> grew so familiar in that house, that no hours were interdicted him, he cunningly drew from the Astrologess an
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:204334:28"/>assurance, that she writ not that Letter he had refused to read, and both from thence, and from what <hi>Timandra</hi> had said to <hi>Amycla,</hi> concluded, That it was the <hi>Phrygian</hi> had writ it, he was raging mad to see her, and to know her commands. But it was almost impossible to compass his desire, <hi>Aglaonice</hi>'s diligence, and the indignation wherewith the <hi>Phrygian</hi> was prepossessed, made fruitless all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</p>
               <p>This ill success made him almost des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, <hi>Amycla</hi> gave him descriptions of <hi>Timandra,</hi> which inflamed his curiosity, and the most moderate desires become violent when they meet with opposition. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had thoughts to banish all he ought to <hi>Socrates</hi> friendship, by forcing a sight of the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Lady, since he could not fairly find a way to obtain it; but the fear to disoblige her, whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready loved before he knew her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him, he bethought himself at length of an Artifice had less noise in it, and which succeeded happily. <hi>Socrates</hi> was almost upon return to <hi>Athens, Alcibiades</hi> pretended to have promised the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> not to go to <hi>Aglaonice</hi>'s, and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly betrayed as much fear to be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:204334:29"/>by the coming of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy to be deprived of the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aglaonice,</hi> to accommodate all it was agreed to meet privately in a Grove, about a mile distant from <hi>Athens,</hi> which was called the <hi>Academy.</hi> In this place Philosophical Conferences were held, and it took its Etymology from <hi>Academes,</hi> a Greek <hi>Hero</hi> born in that place; but since the name has been given to all places where Vertue is publickly exercised. The Conditions being concluded with <hi>Aglao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> the time to put them in execution came, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> made show that <hi>Socrates</hi> was returned, and by Letter conjured the Astrologess to keep her word. She needed not much summoning, she recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends herself to Love and the Stars, and placing this amorous assignation among the favorable Constellations hyes her to the Academy at the hour appointed. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> who had placed his Sentinels at <hi>Timandra</hi>'s door, to know when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of his <hi>Argus,</hi> was no sooner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised that <hi>Aglaonice</hi> was gone, but he hastens to make advantage of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: The Servants would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <hi>Socrates</hi> Order, and hindered <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> from going up to <hi>Timandra</hi>'s
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:204334:29"/>Lodgings; but Love had made him a <hi>Hector,</hi> he threatned with death the first that opposed his passage and coming to the <hi>Phrygians</hi> Chamber, surprised her as much with his sight, as himself was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored with hers. <hi>How, Madam,</hi> (said he, retreating two or three paces) <hi>is it from you I have refused to receive a Letter? Is it to you I have committed the first rudeness that ever I was guilty of towards your sex, and was it against you I conceived so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual an Aversion? Ah Madam,</hi> added he, in a passionate accent, <hi>What can my heart do, to attone the offence of its blindness? Can all the Love and Service it has prepared for you, ever be capable to blot out its crime? I found by your discourse, that you are</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades (replied <hi>Timandra,</hi> in a kind of troubled accent) <hi>the esteem I always had for your reputation, was never so mortified by my anger, but 'tis revived by your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. But Sir, from whence come you? Cannot all the fair Ladies in</hi> Athens <hi>satisfie your curiosity, without searching out her whom</hi> Socrates <hi>forbids you the sight of: Speak not of</hi> Socrates, <hi>I beseech you Madam,</hi> said <hi>Alcibiades</hi> interrupting her; <hi>If he love you, he is no longer dear enough to me to merit so much reservedness, as that I should
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:204334:30"/>forbear it; and if he loves you not, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just to deprive me of your sight. He loves me not,</hi> replied <hi>Timandra, or at least, if he loves me, 'tis more then either of us know. But Sir, he is passionately in love with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he has endeavored to communicate to me that Illustrious Passion; but he fears a merit like yours will be able to destroy all his Precepts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Retire therefore Sir, and leave all my Soul to the Wisdom, to which</hi> Socrates <hi>hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted it. I feel already, I know not what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in speaking to you, which grows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with that constancy and firmness, he has so long Preached. You affect me with some thing, I can neither suppress nor define. Pray then Sir withdraw your sight and</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates <hi>Rules, can never agree together.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades <hi>was transported with Love and Joy at this innocent Confession. Forget</hi> (said he to <hi>Timandra</hi>) <hi>Precepts condemned by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which Heaven testified to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved, when it produced you so fair: It becomes</hi> Socrates <hi>who has onely the Beauty of the Soul in his dividend to renounce the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Sences. He spares himself great vexations, when he prevents the troublesome consequences might accrew from his want of Charm. But you fair</hi> Timandra, <hi>who are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:204334:30"/>made to be adored by all that approach you, reverse the orders of Heaven, when you bury your Talents in a retreat, makes them useless. That which</hi> Socrates <hi>has told me,</hi> said the fair <hi>Phrygian,</hi> interrupting him, <hi>was much more judicious then what you tell me; and yet Sir, by what fate I know not, I begin to find all his knowledge too feeble to perswade me, whilst your words peirce even into my very heart, they have already setled a secret intelligence with the Motions of my Soul, and make my Sence revolt against my Reason: Yet once more Sir retire, your sight becomes pernicious to me, and if you have not some pitty on my Philosophy, three or four years study will fall under the first assaults of your presence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst things passed thus at <hi>Timan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi>'s other accidents, no less singular hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the Academy. <hi>Aglaonice</hi> was come as she had promised, but in going she had lost the note that contained the Order of the Assignation, which was found by one of <hi>Socrates</hi> servants, who carried it to his Master. <hi>Socrates</hi> soon knew <hi>Alcibiades</hi> hand, and the house where he was, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far from the Academy, he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give an interruption to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He often did these displeasures to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:204334:31"/>
                  <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> he loved him tenderly, and he knew that his inclinations to love, were often hurtful to his affairs. He got rid of <hi>Myrto,</hi> who was come that day from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> to fetch him back, and coming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any attendance to the <hi>Philosophers</hi> Grove, he found the <hi>Astrologess</hi> beginning to grumble at the Stars, that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was so long a coming, she believed her cause of grief was ceased when she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Socrates.</hi> It was dark, and the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> who would not show himself, till it were to purpose, slipt among the Trees, <hi>Aglaonice</hi> follows his track, cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice or thrice to discover her self, and seeing that signal ineffective, <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> said she to <hi>Socrates,</hi> in a tone which her vexation changed from her usual voice, <hi>is it for tryal of me that you flie me thus.</hi> The <hi>Philosopher</hi> ashamed at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence of this unknown Lady, stop'd to reproach her for it. <hi>Aglaonice</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he staid, and as she thought for her, run to him with open Arms, but was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly stop'd by a Woman, who rushing from behind a Tree, thrust her self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her, and him, she took for <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades.</hi> This Woman was <hi>Myrto,</hi> who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Husband absent, and learning at
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:204334:31"/>his Countrey House, that he was gone to the Academy, had followed him at a distance to pry into his actions, and see what she could discover. When she had this Reason by the Action of <hi>Aglaonice,</hi> to believe it was an Amorous Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous: <hi>And is it thus</hi> Socrates, said she, <hi>you prepare to dispute for Wisdom against its opposers, must there be an intrigue of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry to dispose your Soul to the defence of Vertue; and do you employ that time you feign to dedicate to the study of Philosophy, in making your self unworthy the name of a Philosopher.</hi> The name of <hi>Socrates</hi> inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aglaonice</hi> of her mistake, she was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a prudent reatreat, when <hi>Plato,</hi> the beloved Scholar of <hi>Socrates,</hi> appeared to hinder her; he had lost some Notes, which he much valued, and came to see if they might not be let fall in the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy, whether he remembred to have brought them, and because it was dark, he had brought a Torch in his hand: That light discovered the <hi>Astrologess</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she could escape. It is not easie to imagine the <hi>Philosophers</hi> surprise at this apparition. <hi>How,</hi> cryed he, <hi>is it you</hi> Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laonice <hi>who have made an assignation with</hi> Alcibiades. The disorder the <hi>Astrologess</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:204334:32"/>was in, joyned with the words she had uttered, assured <hi>Socrates</hi> of a truth, she had not the power to confess; the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher</hi> soon dived into the secret of this intrigue. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was too dainty to court a Creature of <hi>Aglaonices</hi> make. <hi>Socrates</hi> remembred what he had said coming from her house in the <hi>Phrygian</hi> habit. Aglaonice, <hi>feeble</hi> Aglaonice, said he sighing, <hi>thou destroy'st in a moment the precautions of many years.</hi> At these words he runs towards <hi>Timandra</hi>'s; that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Athens</hi> wherein stood the <hi>Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses</hi> house, was not very far from the Academy, <hi>Myrto</hi> followed him for some paces, continuing her clamors; but he vouchsafed not a word to appease her, nay, scarcely did he perceive his Wife speak, so strongly had his suspitions seiz'd his spirit. He found <hi>Alcibiades</hi> still with <hi>Timandra,</hi> he was so charmed with the sight of her, that neither policy in him, nor prayers from her, could make him consent to leave it. <hi>There is Tyranny in what you have done,</hi> said <hi>Socrates,</hi> in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry manner, <hi>You snatch from me a secret I would have kept, and without respect to that friendship should be so dear to you, refuse me the first compliance I ever exacted from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:204334:32"/>yours. 'Tis not that friendship</hi> Socrates <hi>makes you thus hot,</hi> said <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, <hi>your anger would have been better moderated, had it had so easie a cause; but</hi> Socrates <hi>you love</hi> Timandra, <hi>I ever mistrusted it, the disorder wherein now you appear, confirms all my suspitions.</hi> It was most certain, as <hi>Socrates</hi> had protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the prying <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> that he did not believe he loved <hi>Timandra,</hi> he had that confidence in his wisdom, gave him not leisure to examine himself on this point; but his friends reproach forcing him to a sudden review of himself, he found his precaution was strong Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and examining the dreadful fears he had had, least <hi>Timandra</hi> should love or be beloved, he found out that nothing but love could create such violent apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, he let himself fall into a Chair, more concerned with what he began to discover then a criminal at the reading his sentence, and looking on <hi>Alcibiades</hi> with an anger mixed with kindness, which at the same time drew Compassion and Jealousie from his friend. <hi>What have I done to you</hi> Alcibiades, said he, <hi>thus to stir up in my Brest, thoughts I knew not of, and which prove most cruel, because they can
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:204334:33"/>be no longer unknown? I have loved you better, then you have loved your self; I have hazarded my life, my credit, and the esteem of all</hi> Athens, <hi>to maintain your interests; I have opposed your weaknesses and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with all my power, and when I could not master them, have concealed them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful</hi> Alcibiades, <hi>why should you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover mine? If I love not</hi> Timandra, <hi>you injure my reputation in accusing me, and if I love her, as I begin to fear I do, you trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress against friendship, by exposing your self to the hazard of being my Rival. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your self from this danger</hi> Alcibiades, <hi>and whether you regard me as a Philosopher, who would preserve his Schollar exempt from Passion; or whether you regard me as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend, who merits some compliance. Withdraw your self, and see</hi> Timandra <hi>no more. I esteem your Philosophy too much,</hi> said <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> interrupting him, <hi>to do it this injustice; it is fit it should triumph over those desires have the boldness to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with it. Stand out then</hi> Socrates, <hi>and stand out with success, you will sully the glory of your life, if you leave Posterity to believe, that the voluptuous</hi> Alcibiades <hi>had gain'd over himself, what you dare not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise on yours.</hi>

                  <hi>Socrates</hi> was not pleased with these Reasonings, he would have sacrificed all his reputation of Wisdom to the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of loving <hi>Timandra</hi> without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance; but <hi>Alcibiades</hi> keeping firm to his Proposition, <hi>Socrates</hi> was constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to submit, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> loved <hi>Timandra,</hi> and <hi>Timandra</hi> loved him. These Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Wisdom so carefully instilled, and which, a long habitude seemed to have made impregnable against all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations and Assiduities, yielded at the first assaults of <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> 'Twas for this <hi>Timandra</hi> he died some time after, as the Historian of his life tell us, and if I may believe my satyrical memories, it was the displeasure that <hi>Socrates</hi> conceived at this adventure, made him meet death with such constancy. The <hi>Astrologess</hi> was fain to call the Stars to her defence, for the Heart they had made her hope for, but when we are reduced to make use of such Cautions, we find often the Stars but very ill security.

He was yet but <hi>Quaestor,</hi> and had only exerciz'd his courage against
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:204334:35"/>the <hi>Cilician</hi> Pyrates, when he Marry'd <hi>Pompeia</hi> Sister to <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p>In those times as well as now a dayes, the Marriages of Great People were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Politick then Sympathetical unions; <hi>Pompeia</hi> privately loved <hi>Publius Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> had a violent inclination for <hi>Murcia,</hi> who was afterwards the Wife of <hi>Pompey.</hi> The necessity <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> stood in of <hi>Pompey's</hi> support, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from Crossing his Suite to <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and the same reason made him seek his Alliance: He Married the Sister of that great Man the same day that <hi>Pompey</hi> Marryed <hi>Caesars</hi> Mistress: <hi>Love,</hi> which had not so easily complyed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, but to triumph in the progress, would not let <hi>Hymen</hi> rob him of his Rites. <hi>Caesar</hi> loves <hi>Murcia</hi> no less now she is <hi>Pompeys</hi> Wife, then he had done before she was so: Nor did <hi>Claudius</hi> believe himself more unhappy for seeing <hi>Pompeia</hi> in the Armes of <hi>Caesar,</hi> want of opportunity only made some little change in their fortunes. <hi>Pompey</hi> was a Man of Authority, necessary to <hi>Caesars</hi> Ambition; he durst not let him suspect he went to waite on him only to Court his Wife, and therefore restrained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:204334:35"/>to stricter Laws of correspondence then the nearness of Relation might have allowed, so that 'twas only by his eyes that <hi>Murcia</hi> could guess the continuance of his Love. <hi>Pompeia</hi> was committed to the governance of <hi>Aurelia Caesar</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one of the severest Matrons <hi>Rome</hi> ever produc'd; she never suffered her Daughter-in-Law out of her sight but when she trusted her to the care of her Son; <hi>Claudius</hi> could hardly in publick steal a wink; and, if <hi>Albra, Pompeia</hi>'s waiting-woman, and confident of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, had not solac'd the desires of this <hi>Lover</hi> with some kind Messages, he had been constrain'd to renounce his Love or his Life.</p>
               <p>Things stood in this manner when <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> was chosen <hi>Praetor;</hi> and, during the year of his <hi>Praetorship</hi> the Consuls being absent from <hi>Rome,</hi> at his House was to be kept the Feast of the <hi>Good Goddess;</hi> that Feast was signalized among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Dames: and, on the day it was to be Solemniz'd, the Ladies of Quality assembled at the Consuls, or in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence at the <hi>Praetors</hi> House, where they passed the night in Feasts and Dances; and, were it not for some private Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:204334:36"/>to which it was not seemly to admit Men; or, that they feared some escapes of joy repugnant to the <hi>Roman</hi> Austerity, it was made death for any Man to be found at that Feast: <hi>Caesar,</hi> whose Soul was incapable of fear, he knew that improbable attempts oftenest escape with impunity, and resolved to make use of this occasion; There was a Closet in the Alcove of <hi>Pompeia</hi>'s Bed, which answered by a private paire of Staires to a back door, which was very seldome opened; <hi>Caesar</hi> took the Key of this door, and resolving to slip by this way into his Wives Chamber, he writ to <hi>Murcia,</hi> that feigning her selfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispos'd at the Feast, she should desire to repose her self some few Moments on <hi>Pompeia</hi>'s Bed: <hi>Murcia,</hi> who loved <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> and well weighed the hazard of his enterprize, withstood his resolution with all her power; but <hi>Caesar</hi> accusing the faintness of her Love, that Reproach overcame all other considerations. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> left his house at the usual time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he Supt at <hi>Pompeys</hi> to prevent all suspition, he went thence to <hi>Cato</hi>'s, whither he knew his Brother-in-Law would not accompany him, because <hi>Cato</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:204334:36"/>and he were at Enmity; he came to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero's,</hi> and went to two or three places more, that several persons might affirm they had seen him; and then coming to his private door, when he judged it time, he goes without noise, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being discover'd to <hi>Pompeia</hi>'s Closet; scarce was he got in but he heard some body Cough on his Wives Bed, he softly opens the door, and gently approaching the Bed side, <hi>Is it you,</hi> said he, <hi>as softly as possible he could; Yes,</hi> was it answered, (with a voice as low as he had spoke) <hi>It is I; It is a long time I have expected you, and I begun to believe you would break your word: Caesar</hi> dispos'd himself to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his neglect, when he heard the Chamber door open, he hastily throws himself back into the Closet; and, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conversation of those on the Bed were indeed very long, or that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi> impatience made him think it so; most certain it is he never thought time more tedious. That wicked quarter of an hour being ended, <hi>Caesar</hi> distinguishes the voice of his Wife, who making great excuses of not being able to stay longer, took leave, and shut the door after her; he then nimbly comes out of his hole, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:204334:37"/>embracing the Lady on the Bed with a fervour equal to his love: <hi>Murcia, my dear</hi> Murcia, said he, <hi>Is it possible that I have the liberty to confirme with my Tongue what my eyes have so often protested to you.</hi> The Lady snatching out of <hi>Caesars</hi> armes, and throwing her self down from the Bed, sought for the door to save her self: <hi>Caesar</hi> believ'd it some sudden compunction of Conscience come in an evil hour to disturb his Joy, he felt for the Fugitives armes, and having graspt one of them, <hi>From whence comes this confusion,</hi> sayes he, embracing her afresh? <hi>How have I made my self unworthy of the obliging impatience you expressed at my first arrival? Do not discompose your self by these endeavours to escape me,</hi> added he, finding that this <hi>Murcia</hi> strugled to get loose from him, <hi>'Tis in your pleasure to dispose both of your destiny and mine, for you have an absolute power over</hi> Caesar. At that name of <hi>Caesar, Murcia,</hi> or at least the party he took for her, used redoubled endeavours to escape, and that with so much vehemence, that <hi>Caesar</hi> for fear of hurting her was fain to let her go; <hi>Do,</hi> said he, <hi>all that your cruelty can inspire
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:204334:37"/>you with, and if you are not satisfied with throwing into despaire a man that adored you, call the Ladies of the Feast, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me to the rigour of the Laws, I shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least murmur consent to my Death; your procedure having made my life so hateful, that, did I not hope to lose it by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering my self to be surprized here; I had already taken it away. Caesar</hi> had scarce ended this discourse when <hi>Albra</hi> entred the Chamber; she gave a shrieke at the sight of her Master, and would have fled back; <hi>Stay</hi> Albra (said he) with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding voice, <hi>let me save the reputation of what I love, and dispose afterwards of</hi> Caesars <hi>life as thou wilt:</hi> With these words he took a Wax-light out of <hi>Albra</hi>'s hand, and, returning to the Closet, resolved to retire as he came; the person escaped from him was got there before him, and <hi>Caesar</hi> was much surpriz'd to find it to be young <hi>Claudius</hi> the Lover of <hi>Pompeia,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd under the habit of a Woman, he looked wistly at him more then once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he believed his own eyes, till <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> judging, the more he consider'd him the better he must know him; <hi>'Tis I, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> (said he) <hi>you are not deceiv'd, you see 'tis not you only whom love has prevailed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:204334:38"/>with to seek an advantage from the Feast. How</hi> (said <hi>Caesar,</hi> interrupting him) <hi>Was it you whom</hi> Pompeia <hi>came to find when you were laid upon the Bed? and, Was it to give you such full and free entertainment I retreated so quietly into the Closet? You may be deceiv'd in the voice of the Woman that spoke to me,</hi> reply'd <hi>Claudius; But</hi> Caesar, <hi>I can take no other for</hi> Murcia, <hi>you have too often and too plainly named her, and that secret is of counterpoise enough, to exact from you an oblation of your suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if you can destroy me by revealing me, you run the same danger in being revealed; and, if it be true that I love, you love like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and whilst you know not the object of my love, but by conjecture, you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd in express termes, that you love</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey's <hi>Wife.</hi> Caesar, whose reason follow'd <hi>Claudius</hi>'s word for word, and whose am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition had no less a concerne then his love, in the concealing his intrigue with <hi>Murcia,</hi> apprehending it might be both the loss of his Mistress, and ruine of his designes, if he suffer'd his resentments to take place, us'd all his endeavours to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them; and, giving the Light he held to his wives Gallant <hi>Go, march,</hi> said he, <hi>and boast if thou dar'st, that thou hast done</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:204334:38"/>
                  <hi>the greatest injury he can receive, and that he has not the courage to revenge it; Thou mayest now talke whatever thou wilt, the discretion I owe to my Love submits it self to all Censures. Claudius</hi> went down the Privy-staires, which were the same <hi>Albra</hi> had brought him in by; but, one of <hi>Aurelia</hi>'s Women being by chance in the Court near the foot of those Staires seeing <hi>Claudius</hi> put out his light, as soon as he espy'd her, began to have some suspition of the truth; She stop'd the disguis'd Lover, demanding what he was, and whether he went; the confus'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer he gave, and the fulness of his voice made him known for a man. <hi>Aurelia</hi> had notice of the accident, she caused the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony to cease, and sending for Officers commanded <hi>Claudius</hi> to be deliver'd over to the <hi>Censor. Caesar</hi> then appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pretending to be run into the noise, and the fear he was in to be impeached in the Criminals Examination, obliging him to take him out of the hands of his Mother, he caused him to be carry'd to <hi>Cato</hi>'s, whose very near Kinsman he was. <hi>Aurelia</hi> could by no meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this excess of Mercy: <hi>You know not,</hi> said she to her Son, <hi>what kind of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:204334:39"/>Man you save from the rigour of the Laws, he is your Wives Gallant: I have a long time taken notice that wherever they meet, they have observed each other with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composure betraying too much love, and 'twas without doubt by her order he came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disguis'd in that manner:</hi> for, <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s Wife finding her self indisposed, and having desired a moments repose on <hi>Pompeia</hi>'s Bed, she receiving the request with so an unbecoming a manner, that I was forced to lead <hi>Murcia</hi> to mine. <hi>I found not your Wife there when I return'd into the Assembly; I caused</hi> Albra <hi>to search her, and having asked her why she had so left the Feast, she told me that she had a little business in her Chamber; but I'le assure you she lied not, she had indeed great business there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of all this Discourse <hi>Caesar</hi> was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that part only which concern'd <hi>Murcia,</hi> the rest he knew from the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. In the mean time <hi>Claudius</hi> was at <hi>Cato</hi>'s, who sharply reproved his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; <hi>Caesar</hi> could not have chose for him a better retreate: <hi>Cato</hi> loved the young Man as wild as he was, and <hi>Servilia, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s Sister, was the trustee of all his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, she had a long time been in Love
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:204334:39"/>with <hi>Caesar</hi> without finding a way to make him sensible; this disdain had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted her love into an anger equivalent to a violent hate, and as well to find oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to exercise it, as to revenge her self on him that slighted her; She encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd <hi>Claudius</hi> in his passion for <hi>Pompeia,</hi> 'twas she had put him in his Womans dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, and inspired that rashness into him to convey himself into <hi>Caesar</hi>'s house. Now, that by the report of what had passed, she understood 'twas a Rival defended <hi>Julius</hi> his heart against her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; she gave loose reines to all the fury, and all the Jealousie a Womans breast was capable of conceiving: Nor was <hi>Caesar</hi> less tormented within, though the causes of his trouble were different; his Spirit was fierce and delicate, he could not think of the affront he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without such violent indignation as reach'd almost to Madness: But, that rage being balanc'd with what he ought to the honour of <hi>Murcia,</hi> and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity he stood in of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s friendship, he run from thought to thought, and from desperate resolutions to the most pacifick deliberations, and not knowing precisely what to determine on, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:204334:40"/>himself the most miserable man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: He past the rest of the night walking in a disconsolate manner in his Chamber, and assoon as it was day he went to <hi>Pompey</hi> to make Complaint of his Sisters demeanour. <hi>Pompey</hi> would not excuse her, but knowing nothing more of her Crime then that <hi>Claudius</hi> was found disguis'd like a Woman at the feast of the <hi>Good Goddess;</hi> he was of the mind she could not therefore merit all those reproaches wherewith <hi>Caesar</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated her; he therefore urg'd him to say, whether he had any secret light touching that business which the rest of the World knew not? <hi>No,</hi> said <hi>Caesar,</hi> in a perplexed manner, <hi>but it is not enough for the delicacy of my humor, that the Wife of</hi> Caesar <hi>be free from crime, I would have her be so from Suspition.</hi> Pompey us'd all his endeavours to appease <hi>Caesars</hi> anger; he told him, <hi>That in accidents of this nature, Husbands ought to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the best part of their tranquility, that nothing should be believ'd but what was seen: And</hi> Caesar (continued he) <hi>we should in discretion see as little as we can; What advantage gain you in taking away your Wives Reputation? the wrong you do her
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:204334:40"/>recoils on your self; and if you drive on the business to a divorce of her, 'tis an even lay, you take another less honest then she. Chance governs in all Marriages, and Women should be chosen blindfold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After these Learned Sentences they went together towards the Senate, they met <hi>Cato</hi> by the way. Though <hi>Pompey</hi> and he were enemies, yet they forbore not, on occasion, to talk together. <hi>Cato</hi> joyned himself to the two Brothers in Law, and they proceeded all three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Senate; whither, as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, <hi>Caesar</hi> was accosted by an unknown person, who delivered him a Letter, and whispered him in the ear, <hi>That a fair Lady sent it.</hi> He believed it came from <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and the presence of <hi>Pompey</hi> made him blush. <hi>Cato</hi> who always distrusted his ambitious humor, and who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides naturally suspitious, asked him what that Letter was. <hi>'Tis nothing,</hi> replied <hi>Caesar,</hi> in somewhat a discomposed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>You seem to me too much condemned,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Cato, on so light a cause; that Letter certainly contains some attempts against the Commonwealth, and I summon you in your Countreys behalf to deliver it to be shown to the Senate. You are very troublesome with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:204334:41"/>your distrusts Cato,</hi> replied <hi>Caesar. I swear to you by all our Houshold-Gods, this Letter contains onely Family business, wherein</hi> Rome <hi>is not at all concerned. You may speak truth,</hi> answered <hi>Cato</hi> hastily; <hi>but</hi> Caesar <hi>you here receive a Letter visibly discomposes you, and you refuse to show it, when you are pressed to it. What have you so secret to treat of, which</hi> Rome <hi>may not know? She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusts you with all her designs, enterprises nothing without consulting you; and her glory, and her safety, are committed to your discretion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This dispute grew hotter, and <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> beginning to utter offensive words, the Senate would know the difference. If <hi>Cato</hi> did calumniate <hi>Caesar,</hi> it were fit he should make him reparation, and if he spoke truth, it was of importance to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the matter: It was therefore thought convenient to see the Letter in question, and <hi>Pompey</hi> was nominated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer of it. <hi>Caesar</hi> who could not have any one he more suspected, knowing <hi>Cato</hi> for a Wiseman, and <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Enemy; and chusing rather to trust his discretion, then any other, gave him the Letter, which occasioned the dispute; and declaring his intentions to be so pure, he doubted
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:204334:41"/>not his very accusers. He in genernous terms, exhorted <hi>Cato</hi> to make no ill use of the secret he now extorted from him. <hi>Cato</hi> retired to a Window to read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter privately, and opening it found what follows.</p>

                  <hi>Cato</hi> was distracted to find there his Sisters name, and giving some injurious words to the <hi>Praetor,</hi> which History sets down in express terms, he flung out of the Senate in such a huff, that his very countenance was changed. <hi>Caesar</hi> was more surprised at the second sally, then he had been at the first, and following <hi>Cato</hi> to recover his Letter, he went along demanding of him, if he considered well what he did, and for what Reason he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:204334:42"/>tool so much interest in the concerns of his enemies. <hi>Cato</hi> would answer to none of these questions, but getting him home with a hast outstript <hi>Caesars,</hi> he goes to add new fuel to <hi>Servilia</hi>'s indignation. <hi>Caesar</hi> much troubled for the hard fate of his Letter, and willing by any means to retreive it, bethought himself of <hi>Cato</hi>'s sister to aid him in this extremity, he knew that she vehemently loved him; and though he were become unworthy of that love, by his neglect of it, yet he had learnt, that the most violent anger of that kind is blown away at the first appearance of a returning Heart. He writes to <hi>Servilia,</hi> protests that love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to his duty; and making a light apology for what was past, conjures her now to give him the opportunity of extending his Passion. <hi>Cato</hi> had given such orders at home, this Letter could not be delivered, as it was addressed, it was in short intercepted, and <hi>Caesars</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling, passing with <hi>Cato</hi> for a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in offending him, he resolved to revenge the injury, by letting <hi>Pompey</hi> know the wrong <hi>Caesar</hi> did his Sister. The union of these two Brother in Laws had for a long time been an eyesore to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:204334:42"/>
                  <hi>Cato,</hi> and he had secretly sought occasions to reconcile himself to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and to convince him of <hi>Caesars</hi> ambition, he now sends for his friend <hi>Munatius,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing him what he had to do, he gave him the two Letters on which he ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his accusation. This <hi>Munatius</hi> must surely be of a very insinuating spirit, for he it was who had perswaded <hi>Cato</hi> to lend his Wife for some years to <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> and to take her again when <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> was weary of her. He goes to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and aggravating <hi>Caesars</hi> ingratitude, who after having been admitted into so il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious an Alliance, had made himself unworthy of it by his disloyalty to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia. I know,</hi> added he, <hi>you love not</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>and I perceive you could scarce forbear laughing at the humorous part he played yesterday in the Senate. Your factions are different, and in the interests you have to support you, are so frequently of opposite judgments, none can conclude you other then enemies. But Sir, this sort of hatred, though it may destroy Society, should not hinder your esteem for</hi> Cato, <hi>whilst I am sure</hi> Cato <hi>preserves his for the</hi> Great Pompey. <hi>He is justly incensed against</hi> Caesar, <hi>you ought to contribute to his satisfaction, and besides
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:204334:43"/>those Reasons of Equity which are in common among all generous enemies, there are many particular ones to induce you to stop the course of this intrigue.</hi> Caesar <hi>has espoused your Sister, the faults he commits by breach of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Faith, are of ill example to her, and perhaps the story of the good Goddess, was but the reprizal of an offended Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> received <hi>Munatius</hi> advice, like one designed advantage by it, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured him he would employ his credit with <hi>Caesar,</hi> to interrupt his commerce with <hi>Servilia;</hi> but in his Soul, he design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing less then this Tyranny: He was a good and an easie Friend, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred not into his Friends secrets farther then they desired, and onely required from their friendship, a compliance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out constraint, he goes into his Wives Chamber, and tells her with much break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into laughter, what <hi>Munatius</hi> had told him. <hi>Murcia</hi> found not the story so pleasant as it appeared to her Husband, she often changed colour, during its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsal; and reading <hi>Caesars</hi> Letter with a grief, appeared to <hi>Pompey</hi> somewhat se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. <hi>Why,</hi> said he, <hi>do not you think it admirable that</hi> Cato, <hi>the wise</hi> Cato, <hi>should draw a vexation upon himself, so little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:204334:43"/>him? Had you seen with what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness he forced</hi> Caesar <hi>to shew him</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilia<hi>'s Letter, you could not read its contents without laughing as much as I do. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture is indeed something extraordinary,</hi> replied <hi>Murcia; and if</hi> Caesar <hi>had not been concerned in it, I should have found pleasure enough to see</hi> Cato's <hi>mistrust so punished; but I have so much interest in what touches the Husband of your Sister, that I cannot without grief inform my self of the treason wherewith these Letters convince him. This kind of Treason wrongs not the reputation of a Gentleman,</hi> replied <hi>Pompey, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it establishes and adds to it; their worth is judged of by the quality of their love; and the Sister of</hi> Cato <hi>being emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent both for Birth and Beauty, an intrigue with her cannot be dishonorable to the Gallant.</hi> Aurelia <hi>may prophesie some misfortune to her Son, if she hears he violates conjugal faith, and</hi> Pompeia <hi>may revenge her self by some disobedience; but these accidents a part (which as you can well judge) are not the most troublesome of our life) I would give</hi> Caesar <hi>as fair Joy for this conquest, as I would for that of the</hi> Gauls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> came in as <hi>Pompey</hi> finished this discourse, <hi>Murcia</hi> fearing she should not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:204334:44"/>be able to master her Passion, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a Lover, she now believed false, retired into her Closet; and <hi>Pompey</hi> who was in a humor to be merry, putting on a grave countenance, which he had much a do to counterfeit. <hi>I thought,</hi> (says he to his Brother in Law) <hi>I had made my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship so valuable to you, that you would not publickly have renounced it, as you have done: Had none but I known the wrong you do our family, perhaps my love had been great enough to have concealed your fault; but to make</hi> Cato <hi>a witness of it, and that I must hear from my enemies, the injuries you do our Alliance, is a thing,</hi> Caesar, <hi>I could not expect from you, and what surpasses the most detestable ingratitude, Caesar</hi> explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Murcia,</hi> what <hi>Pompey</hi> said to him of <hi>Servilia,</hi> changed colour at every word, his fury to have been betrayed by <hi>Cato,</hi> the despair wherein he represented <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> in his mind, and the confusion he was in to find himself deserving the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Pompey,</hi> brought a colour in his face mixt with shame and anger, that even changed the figure of his countenance. <hi>Pompey</hi> whose anger was counterfeit, and who knew nothing of what was in <hi>Caesars</hi> Heart, had much ado to forbear laughing,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:204334:44"/>he turned his head another way to spin out the Comedy; and complaining of <hi>Caesars</hi> silence, as a contempt that aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated his fault, he made him resolve on a sincere Confession of his offence, and to ask pardon for what was yet onely in design.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To take things in the utmost severity</hi> (said he) <hi>the first steps towards an amorous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, are somewhat uneasie to dainty minds, and so far I may be criminal towards you; for I acknowledge our friendship required me to be scrupulous even to Letters; but</hi> Pompey <hi>I loved before friendship imposed on me the Law of not loving, my love fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not our alliance, on the contrary our alliance has put a bridle on my love; and that which the consideration I had for you, has confined within the limits of Innocent favor, had, without doubt, made farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, had not respect to you extinguished my flames for</hi> Murcia. <hi>Murcia,</hi> who from the Closet into which she was retired, heard all was said in the Chamber, when her name was pronounced, briskly sallies forth. <hi>Say</hi> Servilia, Caesar, (cried she) <hi>your Tongue mistakes your Heart, 'tis from the Sister of</hi> Cato <hi>you received a Letter some days since, as you went to the Senate, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:204334:45"/>not from the Wife of</hi> Pompey; <hi>and pray Sir take heed what you say for the future, and commit no more such mistakes.</hi> There needed no more to recal <hi>Caesar</hi> into the right way of playing his game; <hi>Was it not</hi> Servilia, <hi>that I named,</hi> says he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out seeming to be moved. <hi>No,</hi> said <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> in an angry manner, <hi>'twas my name you pronounced, I ask your Pardon, Madam,</hi> continued <hi>Caesar, the presence of</hi> Pompey <hi>caused that mistake: But Madam, you are too well known to your Husband to be alarm'd at that undue application. Your Vertue is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalised, and this Letter,</hi> said he, taking that <hi>Pompey</hi> held out of his hands, <hi>is an easie rectifier of all;</hi> with that he opened <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilia</hi>'s Letter, and by it understanding part of the truth, said all that a bold and wary Lover could do to draw himself out of the bryars: But <hi>Pompey</hi>'s spirit was too searching to have the change put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with such ease, he was dull and melancholly the rest of that day, and at night recalling to mind <hi>Murcia</hi>'s trouble at the reading <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Letter, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of his Gallant at <hi>Pompey</hi>'s first words, and his wives retiring, he drew thence two or three conjectures as just as they were grievous; he resolved to see
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:204334:45"/>
                  <hi>Servilia,</hi> to be by her enlightned in the obscure sence of her Letter. <hi>Aurelia</hi> who had some Alliance with <hi>Cato,</hi> would not engage in the animosity of <hi>Pompey,</hi> but had entertained a civil commerce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her house and <hi>Servilia's. Pompey</hi> goes next morning to visit his Sister, and making a politick pretence to authorise a secret conference with <hi>Servilia,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages his Sister, to oblige her to come to some place, where he might privately speak with her. <hi>I would draw from her some light touching a design of</hi> Cato<hi>'s, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to my interests,</hi> said he, <hi>and of which, I believe his Sister has some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Pompeia</hi> without examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pompey</hi> spoke truth or dissembled, caused one of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s People to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and sent him to tell <hi>Servilia,</hi> she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired her company in a Garden <hi>Pompey</hi> had upon the <hi>Tiber,</hi> where there were many wonderful close Alleys of great convenience. <hi>Servilia</hi> was at present there with <hi>Caesar,</hi> who by agreement with <hi>Murcia,</hi> endeavored to manage her, and judging this Garden of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed then any other place, to the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises of <hi>Cato,</hi> had chosen those walks for the interview. One of <hi>Servilia</hi>'s Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:204334:46"/>who had received <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Message to her Mistress, seeing one of the <hi>Praetors</hi> people return, imagined him sent to hasten <hi>Servilia. My Mistress in gone,</hi> said she, <hi>she is at</hi> Pompey<hi>'s Garden, at this very time, thou hast nothing to do but return, and might have spared thy pains.</hi> The Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Pompeia</hi> with this Answer, it might have removed the suspitions of <hi>Pompey,</hi> seeing so direct an appearance of intrigue with <hi>Servilia,</hi> which discharged <hi>Murcia</hi> from the concern. But this good Mans jealousie was now grown to that excess, nothing could gain belief from him, but what his sences demonstrated, he comes with all hast to the Garden, and informing himself from the Gardners where those he sought were, expresly forbid the giving any notice of his arrival. <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Servilia</hi> were under a Bower, covered with Roses and Jeffamines, made after the model of the Walks at <hi>Capua. Pompey</hi> slipt himself behind the thick Hedges, and getting softly within reach of their voices, he heard <hi>Caesar</hi> say to <hi>Servilia. You may easily judge, that if I had had any suspition of the truth. I would never have given your Letter to</hi> Cato; <hi>it was my part onely to conceal it from his sight, and</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:204334:46"/>Pompey <hi>was named by the Senate to read it. But who could ever have thought your goodness, was proof against all my ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; and that after so great an indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, never merited by you, you should yet vouchsafe to remember</hi> Caesar. <hi>I complain not of your indiscretion,</hi> said <hi>Servilia, I loved with so much affection, I was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed my love should be known; when a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is extream, it slights vain decencies, and they love weakly whose discretion over-rules their desires. Tell it in open Senate, that</hi> Servilia <hi>loves you, I consent; but then make your self worthy of that love, by sacrificing to it your Passion for</hi> Murcia. <hi>I have told you already,</hi> said <hi>Caesar,</hi> interrupting her, <hi>that I loved</hi> Murcia, <hi>even before I knew what love was; this impression on my first inclinations, cannot be effaced. I must love</hi> Murcia <hi>as long as my heart is capable of loving; but what I ow to</hi> Pompey, <hi>restrains my Passion in such narrow bounds, that it is not all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with a more effective gallantry. Call you then narrow bounds,</hi> said <hi>Servilia,</hi> interrupting, <hi>those discourses your mistake dispenced with the night of the Feast of the</hi> Good Goddess, <hi>in those amorous minutes, Did you at all remember</hi> Pompey? <hi>And if</hi> Claudius <hi>had been</hi> Murcia, <hi>could your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:204334:47"/>for her Husband, have suppressed those extasies of Love, were expressed with so much violence.</hi> Claudius <hi>aggravates things,</hi> replied <hi>Caesar, the Ideas remaining to him of his conversation with</hi> Pompeia, <hi>makes him give a Character to mine, very far beyond the truth. Ah</hi> Caesar, said <hi>Servilia,</hi> interrupting, <hi>If what you said to</hi> Claudius, <hi>believing him</hi> Murcia, <hi>had not been convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, you would not have sacrificed your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments to the necessity you stood in of the discretion of that young man. 'Twas not the fear of death made you so peaceable, your courage is above such effeminate apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and besides the assurance you had, your Wives Gallant was disguised in your house, had furnished you with a pretence to have been hid there; but you spoke in such bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms, that it was a just debt to sacrifice all to the repair of your imprudence. Well then,</hi> said <hi>Caesar,</hi> whom <hi>Claudius</hi>'s indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had raised to an exceeding anger. <hi>It must be true, since you will have it so, that I do love</hi> Pompey<hi>'s Wife; and that I have expressed this love in terms, I feared should be revealed. If you love me</hi> Servilia, <hi>as you would perswade me, you ow some regard to what you believe I love. You change co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour at this discourse, and the moderation I
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:204334:47"/>request, is doubtless not palatable to your jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie; but</hi> Servilia, Caesar<hi>'s Soul is not to be stormed by ordinary approaches, and you are in vain one of the fairest persons in</hi> Rome; <hi>if I find not wherewith to charm my Reason, I shall regard you onely with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency of those fair objects which please the sight without moving the Heart: Would you have me love you, as much as you suspect I love</hi> Pompey<hi>'s Wife; you must sacrifice to me all your anger against</hi> Murcia: <hi>Conceal what you know of the intrigue, and oblige</hi> Claudius <hi>to the same secresie. Are you capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing this for</hi> Caesar? <hi>yes</hi> Caesar, replied <hi>Servilia,</hi> briskly, <hi>I am capable;</hi> Claudius <hi>shall never speak more of it, and I will hold my tongue, but recompence my discretion with some marks of complacency, either feigned or true: I can do any thing for</hi> Caesar, <hi>whilst I am satisfied he loves me, but can answer for nothing when you neglect or abuse my kindness. Spare a fruitless dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> cryed the secret witness to this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, Pompey <hi>knows all you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal; and if you aggravate the heart of</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar, <hi>it shall not be at the expence of</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey<hi>'s ignorance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The voice of <hi>Murcia</hi>'s Husband, which <hi>Caesar</hi> soon knew, threw him into a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:204334:48"/>miserable confusion, he remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable on the Bank where he sat, and <hi>Servilia,</hi> judging of the love he bore her Rival, by the perplexity the consideration wrought, conceived a malign joy at the adventure which she could not dissemble. <hi>You know too much not to know all,</hi> said she to <hi>Pompey, who now entred the Bower. 'Tis true</hi> Caesar <hi>loves</hi> Murcia, <hi>and according to all appearance is not hated; but Sir, among people so intimate, as</hi> Caesar <hi>and you, there should nothing be reserved. You are maliciously disposed,</hi> said <hi>Caesar,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, <hi>you know in your own Soul,</hi> Murcia <hi>has reserved to her Husband alone, all essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial things; and I swear to you</hi> Pompey, <hi>by all that is most Sacred in Heaven and Earth, and as a Man that makes Profession of Honor, That I never obtained any Grace from your Wife, might alarm a Rational Man. I may have had some pretence to hope it, but whether it were Chance crost me, or the address and management of</hi> Murcia, <hi>that hope never had effect. I will believe you</hi> Caesar, replied <hi>Pompey</hi> very coldly, <hi>but as it is not enough for you that</hi> Pompeia <hi>be exempt from crime, unless she be from suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so 'tis too little for me, though</hi> Murcia <hi>continue chast, if she can conceive a thought
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:204334:48"/>of not being so. Caesar</hi> took <hi>Pompey</hi> at the rebound, as he had done him before, he rehearsed all those judicious Sentences he had cited to him on the disguise of <hi>Claudius;</hi> but Counsels of what nature soever they be, lose their efficacy with those that gave them, when they pass through a third Mouth. Pompey repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated <hi>Murcia,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of <hi>Pompeys</hi> rigor repudiated <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia.</hi> This dis-union became publick, <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> were divided with it: <hi>Cato</hi> made advantage of their contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he had proposed, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himself with <hi>Pompey,</hi> became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one of the most obstinate Enemies to <hi>Caesar. Murcia</hi>'s Gallant, mad that his good intentions had such ill success, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged the Caprichios of Fortune on the indiscreet <hi>Claudius,</hi> he exasperated <hi>Cicero</hi> against him, who accused him in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and freely prosecuted his profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the feast. This accusation forced <hi>Claudius</hi> to withdraw from <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> not content with this voluntary exile, had in all likelihood pursued his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his ruine, had not his voyage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and the Victories he there gained, diverted his dire resolutions.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:204334:49"/>
               <p> He had many gallant intrigues, during the ten years, that War continued: Love followed him among Strangers, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook him not even in the Field of Battel, he found Beauties among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> as perfect as those of <hi>Italy,</hi> he loved on the Banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and love left him not when he passed that River, he judged the <hi>English</hi> Ladies worthy the reputation they have gained in the whole World. He dedicated some time to the delights of <hi>Capua,</hi> like another <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and his adventures with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> are famous in all History; but the life of <hi>Caesar</hi> is fertile enough in such adventures, to afford se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Relations.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:204334:50"/>Ignominies can be thrown on him. Hold, hold, <hi>said</hi> Cato, <hi>interruping him, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his head,</hi> I esteem my self not a rush the less for having seen <hi>Martia</hi> in <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> his Armes, and would take her again when forsaken by her Lover as the relict of one of my best friends, if at least I found any benefit by doing it. This is not the sort of moderation that surprizes me, <hi>reply'd</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, <hi>Martia</hi> should not be lookt upon by you as a disloyal Woman, you surrendred her to <hi>Hortensius</hi> by contract in form of Law, and were forced to make use of all the power you had over her, to oblige her to ratifie your Gift. All things in this life wear two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Pompey,</hi> (<hi>reply'd</hi> Cato) and they show to the good or bad but just as the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of man knows how to hold the light to them; Listen to what I never told any but <hi>Munatius,</hi> and judge of the sincerity of my returne in friendship to you, by the secret wherewith I shall intrust you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martia</hi> is (as you well know Sir) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one of the fairest persons of the world; I loved her dearly, and thought she loved me as well: The charmes of her Soul had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and gave new life in my heart to those flames which Marriage usually extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes; I found <hi>Martia</hi> more worthy of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:204334:51"/>love when I absolutely and perfectly knew her, then when decency and good manners conceal'd a part of her merit; and, if the words of a Woman may have any credit with a well-grounded understanding, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> acknowledg'd to have found in me all I discover'd in her: I am in the exterior se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, but this severity is only in appearance; I am in private sociable, and love divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment like other men; and <hi>Martia</hi> us'd to tell me, I prov'd a more loving Husband then she durst hope for when I was but her Lover, she would often say, that that <hi>Cato</hi> which permitted himself to be seen by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friends, was not that <hi>Cato</hi> show'd himself to the Senate and Common-wealth, and methought she spoke truth. I justifi'd her opinion with all the complacencies a wife could expect from the best of Husbands; and those who are perswaded they deserve any ones kindness, easily believe they possess it: I had an absolute confidence in <hi>Martia</hi>'s faith, she might have betray'd me before my own eyes without fear of conviction, she perceiv'd without doubt this advantage, and would not let it lie fallow. <hi>Hortensius</hi> is a handsome Man, his riches vast, which make his expence easie, and Women natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally weak are sooner taken with glittering
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:204334:51"/>then solidity: <hi>Hortensius</hi> was captiv'd by <hi>Martia</hi>'s beauty, and <hi>Martia</hi> yielded her self to <hi>Hortensius</hi> gayety; dispence with me from telling you how they did declare their thoughts, I have not entred into so nice a deduction of the Story: <hi>Martia</hi> has betray'd me, she is at present the Wife of <hi>Hortensius;</hi> great things alwayes presuppose the less, and when effects speak, a discourse of the wayes is needless. <hi>Hortensius</hi> got admission into my House by becoming a feigned servant to my younger Sister <hi>Portia,</hi> being a person both of great honour and as great riches, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions were easily listned to, but <hi>Drusus Livius</hi> our Æ²ncle, under whom we had all been bred, and whom we respect as a Father, is a Man infinitely scrupulous in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of his times, and would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to marry <hi>Portia</hi> the younger before <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilia</hi> her elder Sister; you know <hi>Servilia,</hi> and many other persons know her as well as you, and that Matches for Maids of her humour are rare to be found out. <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> was therefore forced to prepare himself for patience; He at first made it mighty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, but has since acknowledged to <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> that it was a difficulty he foresaw, and for the reason of which alone he chose to ask <hi>Portia</hi> rather then <hi>Servilia.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:204334:52"/>of this supposed Lover appeared to us as sincere as they were false, we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to support his patient expectation with a very strait familiarity, he had the same liberty in my house and my Æ²ncles as if he had been my own brother, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually seem'd to behave himself more and more worthy of the love he professed to my Sister; My Wife grew not at all Jealous of him, she had so well made up conditions of accord with her Lover in that point, that whatever was done for <hi>Portia</hi> was placed to the account of <hi>Martia;</hi> but, it happened not so, nor was she so just with him in the case of <hi>Lucia</hi> Daughter of <hi>Drusus;</hi> she there lookt upon as seeds of Love, what was indeed but a simple Civility; and these sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions troubling and disturbing her humour, which was naturally somewhat imperious, she writ to <hi>Hortensius</hi> in these termes.</p>

                  <hi>She was doubtless about to write the Name of</hi> Martia, <hi>but I gave her not time; I had been at the house</hi> Drusus <hi>had built in the Marches of</hi> Ancona, <hi>and had once designed to spend some time there, but an oppressing Melancholly making me apprehend something had happened to</hi> Martia, <hi>that fear made me post home to rid me of the Suspition of it, and taking upon me the humour of Gallant, that I might surprize my Wife with my arrival, I had forbid my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple giving her notice; I surprized her indeed as I designed, but alass not with such a surprize as my blind passion flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd; she turn'd her head as I entred into the Chamber, and I observ'd a strange kind of trouble in her face, I paid her as much respect as I should have done reproach, taking for a sign of love what proceeded from another principle: I cannot remember I ever carressed her with more obliging kindnesses then at this return. She might have hid the</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>she had writ if she would; the joy
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:204334:53"/>of seeing again my</hi> Martia <hi>so transported me, that I neither observed what she was doing, nor should not have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of whatever she had pleased to do; but, whether she imagined me more quick-sighted, or whether being one of the most witty Women in the World, she apprehended cunning was never better concealed then under the cloak of Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity.</hi> I was, <hi>said she to me smiling,</hi> in a pleasant employ when you just entred, I was writing a Love Letter. <hi>I smil'd in a careless confident way at this discourse, which was soon observed by my Wife,</hi> I see you believe me not, <hi>continu'd she,</hi> but read what is in that Paper and you will perceive I tell no untruth: <hi>I was so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by</hi> Martia<hi>'s wisdome, that I was not at all moved by this</hi> Letter, <hi>but as it was, and had been my divertisement to draw new assurances of the happiness I thought I enjoy'd; I feign'd some amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at it, and asked</hi> Martia <hi>what that</hi> Letter <hi>signify'd? she took a Pen, without giving me an answer, and setting down the name of</hi> Portia <hi>where hers should have stood,</hi> See there, <hi>said she, showing it me,</hi> the resolution of the Riddle, I went yesterday into your Sisters Closet, when she
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:204334:53"/>was not there, a Letter dictated much after this rate lay on the Table, I read it, and found the Contents so singular, that I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to preserve it in my memory to show you at your coming home; <hi>but added she, seeing me begin to look serious,</hi> do not disclose my theft lest you make me fall out with <hi>Portia.</hi> I will not speak of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to my Sister, <hi>reply'd I,</hi> there is nothing in it but is authorized both by <hi>Drusus</hi> orders and my own, but I will advise <hi>Hortensius</hi> to be more Regular in his conduct, his suite to <hi>Portia</hi> has gone now too farr not to have its full effect, and if it be true that he has given her any just cause of complaint, I shall not be satisfy'd with those excuses wherewith such lightnesses are ordinarily colour'd. Martia <hi>told me it was not convenient for me to concern my self in this business, that it was a little quarrel between Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers which Love would conclude upon the first interview.</hi> I vallue not Love at all, <hi>said I interrupting her,</hi> Hortensius pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for my Sister is an affair too serious to be mixed with the revolutions of Gallants intrigues: <hi>And thereupon whatever</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia <hi>could say to stop me, I went directly to seek</hi> Hortensius, <hi>he was walking alone near the Tribunal for Orations.</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensius,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:204334:54"/>
                  <hi>said I, with a composed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> they seldome go unpunish'd who make sport of Men of my ranck; I never sollicited you to love <hi>Portia,</hi> the propositions were made by your self; and, without too much boasting my race and my authority, <hi>Drusus</hi> believ'd he honour'd you in accepting you for his Nephew; and yet I am inform'd that you treat of this affair as a trifle, and intend to make a matter of sport of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of your word with the Sister of <hi>Cato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I (<hi>said</hi> Hortensius, <hi>not a little discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd</hi>) I make a trifle of my Engagements with your family? Pray Sir, from vvhom have you advice carries so little sence with it? From <hi>Portia</hi> her self <hi>(reply'd I)</hi> and, to show you I say nothing without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, read this Letter, and judge if I am informed of your deportment herein. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensius</hi> changed collour, <hi>surpriz'd as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> to receive from my hand a Love-Letter from my Wife.</p>
               <p>The Person that gave you this Letter, <hi>said he, turning a little his head,</hi> has a mind to create mirth to himself at your expence, it comes not from <hi>Portia.</hi> I know it, <hi>(said I)</hi> but its being in <hi>Martia's</hi> hand changes nothing of the thing, 'tis sufficient that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:204334:54"/>Letter is coppied from one, you have, or should have received this morning from my Sister.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Had I known then what I have since,</hi> Hortensius <hi>his very looks would have told me what he thought whilst I thus discoursed; but, at that present, I attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted all his changes of countenance to his confusion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You alarme your self without reason, <hi>(said he)</hi> I have not in my nature such lightness as I am suspected with; I love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what I have loved, and what I shall love till I die: this is an assurance of which I conjure you to become my security, and that you may without scruple do me that service, I call all the gods to witness I speak truth, and may they punish me in your sight if I do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I did what he desired without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I did it, and relating faithfully all this discourse to</hi> Martia, <hi>gave her fresh assurances of the love and constancy of her Gallant: I remember there escaped her from time to time little effluctions of joy, which she could scarce restrain within the limits of a smile, but I made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion on them. She took upon her to relate to</hi> Porcia <hi>what had passed between</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:204334:55"/>Hortensius <hi>and me; and, when I offer'd to ease her of that recital, she perswaded it would not be convenient for me to concerne my self in that commerce:</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, your countenance of authority with your Sisters, <hi>said she,</hi> you know not what need there may be of it; it is not fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too familiar with persons we would pretend to a right of Commanding; and, if you'l be advised by me, I will tell <hi>Portia</hi> that you are ignorant of the liberty she as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes of writing to <hi>Hortensius,</hi> and make her apprehensive of your knowledge of it. I approv'd <hi>Martia's</hi> Counsel, and prais'd it, because I thought it Judicious You then return'd from your <hi>Asiatick</hi> Victories, and the great actions you had done in that part of the World, having made a triumph a debt to you, you yet thought you ought some recompence to the applause of the People. You show'd them a sight of wild Beasts, <hi>Martia</hi> could not be present at this Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, she had got a slip which confin'd her to her bed, and my Sisters seldome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in publick but in her company, staid likewise with her. I know not whether her jealousic were renewed by some new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencies of <hi>Hortensius</hi> for <hi>Lucia;</hi> or, if finding me so perfect in the part I had
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:204334:55"/>play'd upon her Letter, she thought it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to make me play it over again: But she told me that very morning of the spectacle, that she suspected <hi>Lucia</hi> was become the object of <hi>Hortensius</hi> new inclinations, that she had observed some favorable glances pass between them; and adding, it was fit to be searched into, and not suffer him to be in treaty at once, with my Sister, and my Cosin, she engaged me to observe that day the carriage of her lover; she had reason to be well satisfied with my report of it. The Officers who appoint the Seats in the Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatres, had placed <hi>Hortensius</hi> in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the young Men of our Family, part of which he was already reputed, and side by side with <hi>Lucia,</hi> he loudly demanded another Seat; but not obtaining it from the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who show but little tractableness on these occasions, he affected an indifference with <hi>Lucia</hi> almost amounting to incivility, she spoke to him twice or thrice, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered her without looking at her, I observed more plainly how he shun'd giving her his hand to help her down from the Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</p>
               <p>I brought this good news to <hi>Martia,</hi> and not content to have done such a service for her Gallant to her, the next morning I did
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:204334:56"/>the like for her to him, I found him at <hi>Cicero's,</hi> whom I went to pay a visit to, on the marriage of his Daughter with <hi>Lentulus,</hi> I took him aside. The Sacrifice, said I, you yesterday offered to <hi>Portia,</hi> will not be lost to you, I observed all your coldness to <hi>Lucia,</hi> and have desired <hi>Martia</hi> to acquaint your Mistress with it. <hi>Hortensius</hi> lookt at me in a way that has since explained to me what I then knew not. You must not be concerned at my observance, continued I, I was a secret Spie upon you, <hi>Martia</hi> had for my Sisters sake enjoyned me to take some heed to your actions, I have given her a good account, and am consident, you will perceive it the first discourse you have with <hi>Portia. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensius</hi> could not contain himself to see me so excessive a Wittal, but burst out into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent laughter, till perceiving I began to look grave upon it, and by my countenance appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the sally. I ask your pardon <hi>(said he in retiring)</hi> I know the respects ought to be had to your wisdom; but it is so pleasant to me, to hear what I now hear from you, that my weak Sence could not restrain it self at this circumstance. I heard after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that he went directly from <hi>Cicero</hi>'s to my House, and let me beg you to represent to your self, the Scene he had there to play
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:204334:56"/>with <hi>Martia</hi> on the score of my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>This intrigue lasted all the time of my Voyage to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and would have lasted still for ought I know, if the danger into which I was thrown some days after my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, had not furnished me with an occasion to open my eyes. You may remember well, that thinking my self obliged to favour <hi>Domitian,</hi> my particular friend, and now <hi>Portia's</hi> Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, I undertook to have him preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you to the Consulate. I brought him to the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> where you know the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is made, and carried on his interests with so much heat, that your party began a disturbance, a tumult arose, and I was in danger of my life, I received a wound with an Arrow in my right arm; I perceived not my self hurt, during the heat of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, but our faction yielding under the power of yours; and being constrained to save my self by those little by-ways that abut upon the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> I there began to feel the smart I remembred <hi>Martia</hi>'s Nurse lived near that place, and into her House I went to bind up my wound; the Woman grew pale at sight of me, which I thought might proceed from her, being frightned at sight of my Blood. This
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:204334:57"/>is nothing my good friend, said I, give me onely a piece of Linnen to make me a Roller: The little house wherein this Woman dwelt, contained onely a very small Hall where I was, and another Room wherein she lay, and kept her Chests. Alass Sir, said she, half distracted, I have not a Rag to give you, all I have is in that little Room you see, of which my Husband has carried out the Key. I told her she must send for a Smith, she said there was none thereabouts: I bled vehemently, and began to find my self grow weak, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to break open the door, which not being very strong, was no hard matter to do; but I had no more need of any Linnen to stanch my Blood. What I beheld at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that door, seised me with such a Palsie, you might have cut all my Veins, and not let out a drop. There was my disloyal <hi>Martia</hi> shut up with <hi>Hortensius;</hi> the confusion the sight of me wrought in them, appeared to me a guilty distraction. I saw enough for any Husband that loved his Wife, and I believed I saw more then I did. Ah <hi>Pompey</hi> 'tis in vain that love of our selves makes us aspire to the Philosophical insensibility, which lifts up the Wise Man above all Accidents; Men are but Men, and what ever care they take to raise themselves above Nature, the first
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:204334:57"/>movers will still keep their course. I fell into a seat that stood by chance behind me, and sometimes looking on <hi>Hortensius,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on <hi>Martia,</hi> I sought in their eyes that which would have made me mad to find, and perswading my self of my misfortune, without being willing to believe it, I forced my self to think that a Dream, which the impression of my grief, assured me, was too much a truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martia,</hi> not able to endure my sight, went out without having power to speak one word, <hi>Hortensius</hi> followed her example, and my Fury increasing, as my surprise grew less, I was about to run into the utmost extremities, if <hi>Munatius,</hi> who followed me at some distance, had not come into the releif of my decaying Prudence; he found me so changed, that he believed me more wounded then I was, he set himself to comfort me, but kindly repulsing him with my hand, I conjured him not to think of my wound, and told him it was become the least of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series. He attributed this Despair, to the ill success of my undertaking, and composing his countenance to gravity began to upbraid me with weakness.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:204334:58"/>
               <p> How, <hi>said he,</hi> can the election of one Consul for another, put <hi>Cato</hi> into such a dumps? What is become of his so much boasted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage? Return to your self <hi>Cato,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you are accomptable to Posterity, for the esteem which <hi>Rome</hi> has given you. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>replied I feebly,</hi> that 'tis an Election puts me into the despair you find me, but alass it is not that of a new Consul. At that word I grew senceless, but <hi>Munatius</hi> forgetting no offices of a true friend, to give me what assistance was necessary, I soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. My Wound was drest, for it seems <hi>Martia</hi> was run out onely to fetch a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and <hi>Munatius</hi> having sent for a Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they carried me home, <hi>Martia</hi> followed me at a distance, bath'd in her tears for what had hapned to her. The People looked upon them as proceeding from an effect of conjugal Love, though they had a quite contrary cause, and praising her for what merited eternal blame, 'twas from this action she gained that reputation of Vertue with which <hi>Rome</hi> has favored her. She durst not see me neither that day, nor many following, but intrusted <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> with Justification. She protested that <hi>Hortensius</hi> was in the House without being sent for, and if she swore truth, she was not resolved to speak to him, when she had seen
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:204334:58"/>him, but onely to break off all commerce for the future. She acknowledged she had been sensible of his merits, and declared likewise to <hi>Munatius</hi> all I have told you of the secret of the intrigue; but she protested that sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility had still been kept within the bounds of desire, without ever coming to act. I should possibly have become less severe in time <hi>(add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed she)</hi> had I given my self over to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of my heart, that secreet esteem which I dispensed with, had gained more power then I perceived or thought of; and it was to reduce it to its duty that I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding <hi>Hortensius</hi> my sight, when <hi>Cato</hi> surprised us together, swear on my part, That all our discource tended to this prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if the sincerity you may have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the Confessions I make you, deserve any trust with you, procure me the favor of <hi>Cato,</hi> and be assured he shall never have cause to repent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Munatius</hi> acquitted himself faithfully of the Commission he had received, he endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to justifie what was past, and forgot no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make me hope better for the future; but both his Zeal and his Eloquence were fruitless. I had loved <hi>Martia</hi> too well to be reclaimed from a suspition that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed me; I would repudiate her, and had
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:204334:59"/>been hurried to some more memorable revenge had I been governed by my own thoughts: For I imagined in these occasions, my fury was to take its dimentions from my love, and that the life of <hi>Martia</hi> was the onely fit sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Passion I had for her. <hi>Muna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> who was not of my mind, opposed my Severity with all the Reasons he could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>The Evil, <hi>Cato, said he,</hi> which you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, is not an evil in effect, 'tis onely a Chimera founded upon your imagination. <hi>Hortensius</hi> was as much beloved by your Wife before your Voyage to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> as he is at present. If that Mans happiness were to be regarded by you as a real evil, you would have felt the rigor of it more then, than now; yet you then thought to enjoy a perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and now account your self the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate of all Men. Are your Wives merits at all augmented? Are the Laws of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age changed? In short, What is happened should disturb your mind more now, then at that time? I know now my misfortunes, and I could wish to be ignorant of them, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I very sadly.</p>
               <p>You see then, <hi>continued</hi> Munatius, that your grief is onely a fancy, you are wounded now at this time I speak to you; 'twould be
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:204334:59"/>in vain to conceal your Wound from you; you see it, you feel it, and 'tis that we may call a true grief; but to give that name to a thing you have born several years without being sensible of it; believe me, <hi>Cato</hi> is to subvert all Rules of Philosophy. I could no longer hear these Arguments, <hi>Martia</hi> had betrayed me, and I would be revenged, and whatever withstood my vengeance, seemed contrary to Reason. <hi>Munatius</hi> bethought himself of a secret to reclaim my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, he feigned to submit to my obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; and proposing to me the Marriage of <hi>Hortensius</hi> with <hi>Martia,</hi> as a punishment of their crime, perswaded me I might better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge my self this way then any other. The jealousie of Husbands never breaks forth, <hi>says he,</hi> but to their shame and disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their violence aggravates their grief, and their fury ill trained in the art of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, serves onely to adorn that triumph it would prevent; let not <hi>Hortensius</hi> have the glory to pass in <hi>Rome</hi> for the favored Gallant of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Wife, the opinion had of Mans happiness, is often more essential then happiness it self. Why should you procure it for your rival? Rather make him share the danger to which he has exposed you, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:204334:60"/>at best no better then <hi>Cato. Martia</hi> will doubtless treat him as she has treated you, or were he so happy to escape it, he will at least feel the discontent to imagine you des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise <hi>Martia,</hi> since you quit her to him; that very thought will lessen his happiness. 'Tis small satisfaction to the vanity of mankind, to be themselves perswaded of the value of what they possess: If all the world think it not precious, and your seeming indifference creating a real disgust in the heart of this new Husband; he will be the revenger of <hi>Martia</hi>'s disloyalty, whilst she revenges you on <hi>Hortensius</hi> rashness, I surrendred to these Reasons, and <hi>Munatius</hi> undertaking the management of it, that so singular Marriage which Antiquity has no example for; and which, I believe will be as rare in times to come, was concluded in the manner I have told you.</p>
               <p>I signed to my Wives Contract, <hi>Hortensius</hi> received her from my hand, as if she had been my Daughter; and they lived as peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably together, as if I had been dead, or <hi>Martia</hi> never the Wife of <hi>Cato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And would you take this Wife again, <hi>cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Pompey, <hi>when</hi> Cato <hi>had finished his story,</hi> I would neither take her, nor any
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:204334:60"/>other; if I could dispence with it, <hi>replied</hi> Cato. But suppose I were necessitated to marry, and that <hi>Martia</hi> would return to me, she has given me such prejudice against all her Sex, that I believe all Women equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unperfect; and if misfortune on misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune must come, that we are prepared for, is more supportable then that surprises us. I know not, <hi>replied</hi> Pompey, <hi>interrupting him,</hi> Whether the jealousie of Lovers be more violent then that of Husbands? But <hi>Flora</hi> found not me so tractable as <hi>Martia</hi> is like to find you. Pray, <hi>said</hi> Cato, since we are upon the recital of these secret intrigues, let me hear the sum of that story.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flora</hi> was but a Curtizan, but by her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty became so famous, that her love to you is none of the least presents you have received from your good Fortune; and the secret of your breach with her, has come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of so few, that I shall be highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged if you intrust me with it.</p>
               <p>I care not for falling into that Discourse, <hi>replied</hi> Pompey, it is not for <hi>Flora</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and though 'tis true, she was but a Curtizan, yet I once so dearly loved her, I still preserve a respect for her; but it is fit I sacrifice something to the desires of <hi>Cato,</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:204334:61"/>shall it ever be said I refused the first mark of friendship demanded after our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
               <p>'Tis difficult to define, that Love agrees with my Nature, it has all the violencies of debauchery, and yet has ever been restrained within the bounds of Vertue. 'Tis a conjugal tie must put a stop to my Heart; and where other Mens desires enter into their Tomb, and are buried, mine receive Spring and Life. I showed such overflowings of Passion to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistia,</hi> my first Wife, That People of my Age reproached me with it, as an extremity of weakness. I had been no less kind to <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Daughter, had I had time to have perceived I was her Husband; and the disloyal <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> will assure all the World, that it was not any coldness or indifference of mine inspired her with the design of betraying me. Such a particular inclination agreed not with the title of Curtizan, which we cannot dispence with the giving to <hi>Flora;</hi> but could I at that time have foreseen, she would ever have deserved it, she should never have been the Mistress of <hi>Pompey;</hi> but she tendred her self to my heart in such honest appearances, that they overcame all scruples.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:204334:61"/>
               <p> I was one day with <hi>Caecilius Metellus,</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> which was then to be dedicated, and to take care of its adorning, <hi>Metellus</hi> had Commission from the Senate; he discharged his trust with as much care as magnificence, and that I might be a witness of it, he had then carried me into the Temple: I there beheld many Pictures of an exquisite perfection, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest, one of the Conception of the Twins, where <hi>Leda</hi> was represented so fair, it was impossible to look on her, and not envy the divine Swan that enjoyed her. The Painter who drew this piece, said I to <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> had his fancy very excellent, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; it were to be wisht Nature were as perfect in her Lineaments, we should not then see so many ill faces as we daily do. Nature deserves all the praises you give the Painter, <hi>replied</hi> Metellus, that face of <hi>Leda</hi>'s is taken from a young <hi>Roman,</hi> whose Beauty far exceeds that representation you there see.</p>
               <p>Is it possible, cried I, that there can be a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>Rome,</hi> as fair as that painting, and she not be as famous as the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and other Singularities of the City?</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:204334:62"/>
               <p> The young <hi>Flora</hi> whom this Picture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, <hi>answered</hi> Metellus, is of so mean a Birth, that she has been as it were buried in that obscurity, she is onely the daughter of a Mechanick; and if he had not formerly wrought in my House, <hi>Flora</hi> had been as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me as to all other people of quality; but <hi>Pompey,</hi> that low Birth has not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoil'd <hi>Flora</hi> of a great Soul: 'Tis a small matter to see this Portraict, and to know that it flatters not the Original. I will tell you, to perfect her description, that I have loved this Maid for above two years, and that there are no marks of Love capable to beget a sence of it, in persons of her Character and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which she has not received of me. I load her with presents, I maintain the whole Family, and would inrich it for ever, if <hi>Flora</hi> would but comply with my desires; but imperious as she is, she disdains all my offers, and stands more on her Beauty, then I can, either on my Birth or Quality. She believes she should honor me in accepting me for her Husband, if my Passion could carry me to that extravagance.</p>
               <p>Flora <hi>entred the Temple as</hi> Metellus <hi>ended his Discourse, she came to sit for some touches of a Picture wherein</hi> Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnestra
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:204334:62"/>
                  <hi>was represented under some of her Features.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I protest I was dazled with the Beauty of the Maid, and if I may say it, she thought me not unworthy to be considered, she blusht as soon as her eyes met with mine, she looked earnestly at me when I feigned to look off her, and she seem'd troubled to turn away, when I surprised her with a glance. I prais'd her Beauty exceedingly, and I told <hi>Metellus</hi> he had administred a necessary preservative, when he had told me of her cruelty; she bravely defended her self from that quality, and told <hi>Metellus</hi> in a pretty scornful way, that often the title of Cruelty was given to what was but a result of right Reason; and at the pronouncing that word, turning her eyes towards me, methought I read in them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny happier for me then that of <hi>Metellus.</hi> You know well such favorable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are seldom neglected. I caused <hi>Flora</hi> be followed to learn her dwelling, and on the morrow pretended some necessary business to employ her Father in, and made use of the Occasion to speak with her.</p>
               <p>I was at this time a Widower, having bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Daughter, and not yet faln in league with <hi>Murcia,</hi> so that I looked upon an
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:204334:63"/>intrigue with <hi>Flora</hi> to be the most pleasing amusement of my mind I could find out. Sympathy had prepared me the way, I need but speak to be listned to, and I fancy, had I kept silence, I had been intreated to break it. Facility generally disgusts delicated nice Minds, but it produces a contrary effect, when a Lover regards it as a miracle of Love. That of <hi>Flora</hi> had this Character. What <hi>Metellus</hi> had told me of the Vertue of this Maid, what I daily discovered of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation she had gained; and more then all that, somewhat of a sincere pressing forward of my heart, and fully discovering to me that of my Mistress, perswaded me that all the love in her was new, and that no Star in the World but <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, could have had that influence.</p>
               <p>You may judge by what I have told you, of the discourse I had with <hi>Metellus,</hi> he could be no long time without perceiving my good Fortune; he had a mind to be cleared in his suspitions, and <hi>Flora</hi> thinking her Love an Honor, never took the pains to disguise it to my Rival.</p>
               <p>Yes <hi>Metellus, said she,</hi> I love <hi>Pompey,</hi> one main circumstance would be wanting to my happiness, if you should not know his;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204334:63"/>and my heart would be an offering unworthy so great a Man, should it not be accompanied with a sacrifice of your desires.</p>
               <p>This Declaration making <hi>Metellus</hi> observe as much Disdain in it as Ingenuity, transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Jealousie almost to a Fury; I was forced to use all my credit and authority to rescue <hi>Flora</hi>'s family from the effects of his anger, and had he not died about that time, he had possibly done by stratagem, what he could not do by open force. His death leaving me in a peaceable possession of the fair and loving <hi>Flora,</hi> I cannot say Iever passed more happy time, then the first five or six Moneths of this intrigue; but there's no happiness last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here below, and Man would forget the end for which he was born, if the Providence of the Wise God did not mix his pleasures with some pain. <hi>Geminius,</hi> the Companion of my Studies, and Comrade of my Travels, and whom next <hi>Flora</hi> I loved more then all the World, became unhappily in love with this fair Maid, I concealed from him none of the secrets of my Soul, he knew my Love, and representing to himself the dispair into which I should fall, if I should find my self betrayed by <hi>Flora,</hi> used incredible endeavors to suppress this powerful inclination. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:204334:64"/>of the Soul are more dangerous to a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Man, then the most Bloody Battles. <hi>Geminius</hi> fell grievously sick, I stir'd not from his Bed-side, and <hi>Flora</hi> who could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear my sight no more then I hers, spent whole days with me in this sick Mans Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Our love was violent, and scarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it self before suspected witnesses, but we constrained it not before our best Friends.</p>
               <p>I was still speaking kind and feeling things to <hi>Flora,</hi> and she answered me in terms every way as touching, our eyes made a continual commerce of eloquent glances, and the most indifferent things were advanced to profit by our laborious Passion, every thing turning into an occasion of expressing the warmth of our desires. Judge into what condition we put the passionate and discreet <hi>Geminius;</hi> he was brought to that extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Physitians gave him over; and when he felt his death approaching he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me the cause of it. The Friendship I had for <hi>Geminius,</hi> could not be balanced by any thing, but my love to <hi>Flora,</hi> were I to have parted with my life to save my friends, I should have given it without reflexion; but when I understood <hi>Flora</hi> was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:204334:64"/>I asked time to resolve; resolve nothing <hi>Pompey</hi> said the dying <hi>Geminius,</hi> I discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not my grief to find a remedy; I am too happy to die for that I love best in the World, and though your generosity would contribute to my recovery, I know it depends not on you, your happiness is so great, it dazles you, and you see but a part of it. I am (since so De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny pleases) more clear sighted, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served particulars in the love of <hi>Flora,</hi> that destroy the confidence I could have in your friendship. Live happy, and let me die mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and give not that increase to my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to let them cost you one sorrowful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion.</p>
               <p>This discourse pronounced by an expiring Man, and one I so dearly loved, touched me to the very Soul, I thought I ought to my friends life, at least, a seeming willingness to contribute to his cure; and presuming enough on <hi>Flora</hi>'s constancy to believe she would preserve her self wholly to me in despite of my self, I assured <hi>Geminius</hi> that if he could gain her love, I would look on his happiness without a murmur: I have not faith enough in the fictions of the Poets, to believe this assurance restored <hi>Geminius</hi> life, but his disease being come to the Christs, certain it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:204334:65"/>is, that from that day we observed his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. I resolved to assist it by my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and as well to convince him of my sincerity, as to avoid the reproaches of <hi>Flora,</hi> I went to spend some time at the Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, whether <hi>Sylla</hi> was retired, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid down the Dictatorship.</p>
               <p>I writ every day to <hi>Flora,</hi> Letters full of that Love possest my Soul. I had not engaged never to love her more, but onely promised she should love my friend if she could. Wretch that she was, she could but do it too much; Love is no mighty task to one of that Sex.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Geminius</hi> Painted my slight compliance with such lively colours, that at my return to <hi>Rome,</hi> I learned from <hi>Flora</hi>'s own Mouth her infidelity. How, cryed I, can it be true, that you loved <hi>Pompey</hi> with so much fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, and cease to love him with so much ease? Who has told you I have ceas'd to love you, <hi>replied</hi> Flora? Do you give the title of change to that sacrifice you constrained? Is it because I have restored you a Friend, whose loss had made you desperate, that you accuse me with want of love? Alass, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a thousand thanks for my chearful obedience, 'twas a thousand tortures to me
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:204334:65"/>to yield to it; and I made use of all the powers of my kindness to resolve upon, what you reproach for a decay of Passion.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Flora,</hi> said I, how cruel is your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to me? How much more would you have obliged me, had I found you less sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flora</hi> ask'd pardon for her error, and swore to me, she would stop the career of it, and doubtless would have done as the said: That deadly grief she expressed at our sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, hath fully perswaded me <hi>Gemini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> destroyed me with my own Weapon, and that <hi>Flora</hi> believed she pleased me in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying me; but the remembrance of that inconstancy has given me disgusts, I could never vanquish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flora</hi> forbore to see my Rival any more, she felt a remorse for her credulity, which almost cost her her life. I loved her a long time after our rupture, and her memory is yet grateful to me; but <hi>Cato,</hi> I was born nice and delicate, and in my mind true love is incompatible of partnership.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Night rather then want of Matter, broke off the converse of these two Ilustrious</hi> Romans. <hi>I shall find out a way
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:204334:66"/>to renew it hereafter, but it is good to make use of the leisure of contriving it; and leaving these two reconciled Enemies to their quiet rest, endeavor after their example, to enjoy some time of repose.</hi>

In one of these Chaces, the Dutchess <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> Natural Daughter to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> coming near to the Inclosure they had made, a Wild Boar broke the Toyls, and frighting her
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:204334:67"/>Horse, he ran clear away with her to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left-hand, <hi>D'Andelots</hi> Horse frighted at the same accident, followed Madam <hi>D'Aumales;</hi> her Husband was: good way off, with Prince <hi>Patien,</hi> an Madam <hi>L' Admirale de Brion;</hi> two other Ladies who were near the Dutchess, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, that weak assistance being all they could give her, none daring to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their skill in riding at her rate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> who pursued her on full speed. The cry came soon to the Duke, who hearing how his Ladies Horse was frightned, had not been concerned for her, had he not at the same time heard that <hi>D'Andelots</hi> with a likefright, took the same way with the Dutchesses, he rid then with all speed to overtake them. <hi>D'Andelot</hi> who could not guide his Horse, letting him run where-ever he pleased, heard a noise beside him, and saw Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> coming up very near him, but in a moment she was passed him, and he lost sight of her, by reason of a small Coppice was before him, which the way dividing in two, he was forced to enter, and there saw Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> faln. That sight made him strive hard again to stop his Horse, but since he could
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204334:67"/>not, he threw himself down to take care of her, whom he feared was hurt; she was almost stunded, and in that disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der discovered some part of her fair body. There is scarce that Love and Constancy in the World, can resist against so many Beauties, and though possibly this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes sight, changed not utterly the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>D'Andelots</hi> love, yet so pleasing an adventure made him at least very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; but care of the Dutchess made him soon forego the pleasure he reaped with his eyes. He was come to her, and had just taken her in his arms to lift her up, when the Duke and Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> arrived; yet he gave not over his offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous employ, and the asking her, whether she was hurt. The Dutchess thought her self alone with him, and was reaching her lips to his, but he turned his head the other way; a refusal she would have looked upon, as a rude injury to her Love and Beauty, had not she sooner perceived what was the cause of a Modesty Men are seldom guilty of. But what a sight was this for a jealous Husband, who was both suspicious of his Wives humor, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Gallants worth; nor in reason had Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> less cause of grief,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:204334:68"/>suffice it both felt what was hard to be expressed even by themselves; nor were Madam <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> nor <hi>D'Andelot,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their share of jealousie and trouble; and whilst they could not utter what they thought, their thoughts were the more oppressive.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> having a little hurt on her hand and knee, was in her Coach carried back to <hi>Fountainbleau;</hi> but her hurts being slight, the Men waited not on her, but returned to the sport, and took their Darts to assail the Wild Boars. <hi>D'Andelots</hi> Horse being wounded by one of the largest, he was forced to alight, and assail him on foot. The Duke <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> had a care of him, though he was both his Wives Gallant, and the Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rival that rob'd him of Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> Heart, and coming up to the Boar, lanced his Dart at the same time that <hi>D'Andelot</hi> plunged his in the Boars shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, his throw was unlucky, wounding <hi>D'Andelot</hi> in the hand, as it passed into the Boars Flanck, who immediately fell. This unhappy accident much added to the Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi>'s trouble, though chance and misfortune contributed more to <hi>D'Andelots</hi> wound then he, which yet
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:204334:68"/>was not so great, but he returned on horsback to <hi>Fountainbleau.</hi>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:204334:69"/>the pleasure of an indifferent and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous converse, which was somewhat hard to advance; but which I begun to desire might become more satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> had not yet perceived in me what I desired she should, her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned and indifferent carriage made me fearful of success, but love emboldned me. It may be, I put too much trust in him; but when we find we must love, and are sure to love well, what is it we are not inclined to hope from so fair a Passion.</p>
                  <p>I was one day with her, when an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Painter brought some Pictures to sell; he hapned to be in the City when the Siege was laid to it, and was forced to stay there till it was drawn off, having heard of the arrival of the Prince and Princess; he had showed them some Picture which they had bought, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed that Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> loved them, he brought what he had left to her Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Painter</hi> spoke <hi>French</hi> so ill, he could scarce be understood. I earnestly viewed one of his Pictures, which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Brion</hi> observing, and finding some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:204334:70"/>in it both curious and pleasant, askt me if I knew the story.</p>
                  <p>The ingenious Fable you there see discribed Madam, said I, is taken out of the Works of the famous <hi>Tasso. Armida</hi> the Enchantress having received many cruel affronte from <hi>Rinaldo</hi> before she knew him, was resolved on revenge; she advances towards the Christian Camp, discovers, approaches, and in short, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it under pretence of craving aid from <hi>Godfrey</hi> the General. <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> who till then, had never thought of love, could not restrain his eyes from wandring on hers, his heart sob'd and was troubled, and began to feel for <hi>Armida,</hi> what it had never felt before. How glad was he when she made choice of him in the occasion she pretended to have to make use of valor? Though <hi>Armida</hi> was learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all Magick Sciences, and knew well the vertues and power of all Simples, Characters, and Words; yet her greatest charm and strongest enchantment lay in her Beauty; which <hi>Tasso</hi> tells us, was so commanding, that the whole Camp would have followed her. But <hi>Rinaldo</hi> gains the preference, because she onely asked for him. <hi>Armida</hi> having now got
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:204334:70"/>her enemy into her hands, buries her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in looking on him: Love banisht indignation, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> was too brave and too much inamored to prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to so kind and fair a person. <hi>Armida</hi> builds an inchanted Palace, and in the Gardens of that Palace which you there see represented, these two lovers forgot every thing else to enjoy all the pleasures of love. Take notice, Madam, of that young Lady, seated on the Banks of a Fountain, proceeded I, showing her by her eyes, by her air, by her features, you cannot judge her other then <hi>Armida;</hi> and that lovely handsome Man, cannot be other then <hi>Rinaldo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Painter, who doubtless sought in the whole story, some what might appear most pleasing, could find nothing more proper then this to represent, which he has done with so much art, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to behold <hi>Armida</hi> so full of love and beauty, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> so handsome and so passionate without desiring to be in love.</p>
                  <p>I observed the Admiral was pleased with hearkning to me, and it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented me to see her buy the Picture. The Princess just in the nick came to take her
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:204334:71"/>out to walk, and I'll promise you this was the first time ever her sight had griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; the Picture had given me the opportunity to enter on some discourse of my love, which I had determined not to lose, but now was constrained.</p>
                  <p>Going thence I met with <hi>Saint Cire,</hi> who told me the Prince would speak with me. I hastned to him, but found 'twas no state affair he had to communicate; you know him, and know he is very incline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to love, and hard to forego it, once entred into. Mademoiselle <hi>de Bourlemoni</hi> whom you have see near the Princess, had smitten him ere he was aware, the letting her know it, was a thing wherein the Prince was obliged to observe much Caution: Yet he had so well ordered the affair that he had spoke, and the Lady had not believed it dangerous to hearken to him; nay more, she appeared jealous, as if she could have wished the Princes love no straggler.</p>
                  <p>This was in short what he had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, having drawn me to a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that none else might hear, he told me he had chosen me for his confident, and encouraging me thereby to a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I declared to him my concern for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:204334:71"/>Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> he promised me, and I assured him of a reciprocal assistance in his love.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon we went into the walks to wait on the Princess and the Admiral, who as soon as we came up to her, 'tis tedious being here said she to me, cannot you invent some pleasing divertisement to drive away melancholly. I have it at hand Madam, said I, what can be more pleasant then to talk of love, you have nothing here to divert it, and I find my heart inclineable to treat of it with none but you. Where did you learn to talk thus, said she, smiling; who has taught you to look so on me, Madam, replied I, in a jovial manner, but was much afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I could say no more, for <hi>Bourlemont</hi> and another of the Princess Women coming up to us, interrupted us, and I could not find a minutes opportunity all that Evening to continue what I had begun.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bourlemont</hi> who took notice with what delight I observed Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> softly in my ear, asked me, if I were in love; as much as the Prince is with you, replied I, so that the rest might not hear: She would needs know what I meant by that,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:204334:72"/>and I explained it to her, she blusht, and seem'd coy, as if she desired not his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but I judged the contrary, and told my observations to the Prince, who requited them with giving me such an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of his Negotiations with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, that I began to believe my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts not impossible.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the Duke <hi>D' Aumale</hi> came to <hi>Orleans</hi> to treat on the Kings behalf, as you very well know about the Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some places, which the Prince could hardly consent to. The Dutchess was with him, whose arrival, turned the whole Town into pleasure and divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and many days were spent in Feasts and Balls.</p>
                  <p>That day the Dutchess coming was first known, I happened to be with Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> we were at first talking of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand indifferent things; but in the end, I changed the discourse, endeavoring to improve those few minutes my good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune gave me. The Admiral answered very wittily to all I said of my Passion; but I sought a return of love, and was little satisfied with those reperties. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the melancholly and seriousness, with which I discoursed, caused some joy
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:204334:72"/>in her, and I loved her too well to rob her of that pleasure. I guessed, Madam, said I, that love would rejoyce you, and you would not believe me; but if you would now frankly declare your thoughts, I am sure they must agree with mine.</p>
                  <p>I'll swear your company does divertise me, replied she, and I cannot but laugh at your design of Courtship; but you must understand I have a kind of stubborn heart, that neither knows love, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to know it: I'll awaken that desire in it, Madam, replied I, and will assure you, on Loves behalf, he takes it very ill you should treat me so cruelly. Take heed of quarrelling with him, he is a powerful enemy, who infallibly revenges himself on his despisers. To let you see I don't fear him, replied she, I'll wager with you, he never overcomes me: Do not lay any wagers, answered I, for you will be sure to lose.</p>
                  <p>She would not take my advice, and we concluded to agree on the wager, when <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> came in, and was chosen judge, if any difference happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, she is a Kinswoman of hers whom you have often seen with her, and who had a great power over her. We
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:204334:73"/>had much ado to agree what our wager should be, I would have had hers to have been some favors, but that was not her design; yet having represented to her, that she run no hazard, being as she af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, she was sure to win, she consented in the end, to engage to admit my utmost service, and I consented never to see her more, and to quit the Princes party, if I lost. What will not men in love pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise? I gave her my word, and she assured me hers; two Moneths was the time allowed for tryal, at the end of which, <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> was to give judgment which had won: I took my leave of her, with telling her, that I was resolved to neglect nothing to gain her; she answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that she already accounted me of the Kings party, and I you Madam, said I, of loves.</p>
                  <p>I came thence well satisfied with what I had said, and what I had done, and my joy made the Prince suspect me more happy then he. I endeavored to perswade him the contrary, who easily believed me, but I told him nothing of the wager. You cannot imagine, said he to me, how lovely <hi>Bourlemont</hi> appears to me, I fancy I shall ever love her. All say so, said I, when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:204334:73"/>they begin to be in love; and there is a pretty delight in saying and thinking our love shall never end; but afterwards when its fervency begins decay, and the kindness decreases without knowing a reason for it. Believe me, we return to our selves, and to our wonted tempers and yours, being to be inconstant; so soon as you are satisfied, we shall hear no more from you, that Madam <hi>Bourlemont</hi> is fair, or that you shall love for ever. Its very true, answered he, I love change, and finding it delightful, cannot think of confining my self. Believe me, <hi>D' Andelot</hi> there are pleasures in inconstancy, and 'tis a mighty satisfaction, to make love in a great many places at once, and to find answers suitable to our desires.</p>
                  <p>I left the Prince in this opinion, in which I could not resolve to imitate him.</p>
                  <p>That Evening the Duke and Dutchess <hi>D' Aumale</hi> arrived, there was a Ball at the Princes, where I received, without thinking of it, some favorable glances from Madam <hi>D' Aumale.</hi> I desired not hers, but Madam <hi>de Brions,</hi> whom the Duke entertained, and me thought I observed in his addresses to her, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:204334:74"/>thing of the courtship of a Man in love. He was a Rival might well be feared, the Admiral hearkned to him, and my jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie made me discover a thousand things distracted me. The Dutchess came to take me out to dance, and I left her not all that Evening. Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served what I did, I perceived it, but I forbore not discoursing with the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow the Duke came to visit the Admiral, I happened to be there, and having observed her more nearly then at the Ball, began to suspect her already in a condition to make me lose my wager, the loss was considerable, and many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons obliged me to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>Mean time the Prince prosecuted his love with <hi>Bourlemont,</hi> and his endeavors were not successless, he had the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to know she did not hate him; he let me know his happiness, and not trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any other the secret of his Passion, gave me a Letter for her, but I lost it, and it unhappily fell into Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> hands, who not knowing my Character, thought after having read the following Lines I had deserted her for the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                        <p>YOu unjustly accuse me with loving the Admiral, have a better opinion of your own Beauty, and my Faith, and think not I can love by halves. 'Tis possible I may have given occasion for your suspitions by those enterviews you have seen between us; but believe me, they were not all on the score of love, and when their causes shall be known, you will repent you: Injustice and I shall have the satisfaction not to have any cause to reproach you.</p>

                  <p>Though at the sight of this, she dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a joy and content, I found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards she had much ado to restrain her grief and anguish.</p>
                  <p>The Dutchess loved her very well, and that she might have the more of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, she left her Lodgings, and went to sojourn at Madam <hi>D' Aumales,</hi> during her stay at <hi>Orleans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first night she went to lie there, there happened a tumult in the City. One of the Duke <hi>D' Aumales</hi> servants quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a Citizen, who was wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed for the party, and called him Rebel: He could not endure that injury, and the servant was very scurvily treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:204334:75"/>other servants came in to his aid, and the Neighbors to the Citizens. The quarrel grew general, and the Citizens in great numbers pressed even to the Dukes Gates, and entered them, and their animosity made it be feared they would force in that tumultuous manner through all the Lodgings. The Duke <hi>D' Aumale</hi> being with the Prince, had news of the commotion, and having told it me, I made haste and came just at the instant they had past the Court, and were breaking open the Dutchess Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I appeased the multitude, and at my name the door was opened, and I took the Dutchess, and conveyed her out by a convenient postern.</p>
                  <p>I knew not that the Admiral had that night changed Lodings, nor did the Dutchess tell me so, till I had put her in a place of security. <hi>Saint Cire,</hi> whom I had made stay at the Dukes Lodgings to compleat the appeasing of the tumult, took care of the Admiral, and I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately to see if I were obeyed, was surprised to see Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with <hi>Saint Cire,</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting her to the Princesses, I excused my self, not knowing her to have been
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:204334:75"/>at the Dutchesses, she received my excuse very coldly, yet upbraided me not, but civilly dispenced with my attending her.</p>
                  <p>The Prince understanding from <hi>Bourle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> I had not given her his Letter, asked me, what I had done with it; I told him how I had lost it, and sought in vain for it, in all places where I had been. <hi>Bourlemont</hi> was mighty angry at my neglect, fearing his privacies with the Prince might take air by it; but I sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied her by telling her, none could sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to whom it was writ, being without superscription; and the hand was so well counterfeited, 'twould rather be taken for mine, then the Princes.</p>
                  <p>All which was but too true, and that resemblance but too much justified, when the <hi>Admirale</hi> saw in the Dutchess hands Verses, she had prayed me to give her, and which I had writ.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I who suspected not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>De Brions</hi> thoughts, employed all my cares to incline her affection: The Duke managed the same design, and I often feared with better success then my self.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:204334:76"/>
                  <p> Though the Dutchess was still extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favourable to me, yet I constrained my self not to perceive what she would have me see; how easie had been my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage unto her Heart, had I had a design to enter it. All Prince <hi>Portian</hi>'s Merit had vanished for me, and I plainly saw it must be my fault if I were not beloved by one of the fairest Persons of the world, but I could not consent to it, whilst my Love to the <hi>Admirale</hi> withstood it, and I chose rather to be constant and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with her, then dearly beloved else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                  <p>My mind told me, these thoughts ought to hope for some reward, if they were but known, but there was nothing beheld in me but Treason and Inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that was a strange kind of way to gain Love from any Person.</p>
                  <p>They were playing one night at the Princesses, the <hi>Admirale</hi> was onely look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and I thought it a convenient time to speak to her, and having drawn her out of the hearing of the company, I begin to apprehend, said I, that you will not love me, and that I shall lose my wager, but Madam, is not the Duke <hi>D' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> the causer? that reproach drew on
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:204334:76"/>hers, and she appeared to me full of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and jealousie, and yet in the mixture I could discern some Love; you will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that loss with Madam <hi>D' Aumale,</hi> said she, and her Beauty will make good all you can lose by me, Ah Madam, 'tis onely your heart I am ambitious of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed I, and though I cannot obtain it with all my sufferings, I will never give you the pleasure to call me unfaithful. You have fully done it already, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed she with a disdainful smile, but you deserve not I should complain of you; that would be a mark of esteem, and I have onely scorn for you: I besought her to no purpose, to explain why she treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me thus. She returned to see them play, and I withdrew, satisfied to know a part of her thoughts, but terribly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at the reproach she made me.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>D' Aumale</hi> having finished his Treaty with the Prince, returned to Court. The Dutchess at departure, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me sad and melancholly, attributed it to her self, and obliged her thoughts with an opinion I was concerned for her. The <hi>Admirale</hi> thought as she did, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for some time that she staied at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> to shun my company and scorn me.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:204334:77"/>
                  <p> The Constable being brought back to the City, the Prince and Princess went thence together with Madam <hi>de Brion.</hi> She would not have seen me, but I would wait on her on the way; I expected at least some indifferent regards, but I had not so much as the small content, and believed my self unhappy. <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> perceiving my grief, made me assign to hope, and I answered her by other signs.</p>
                  <p>My Brother the Admiral was come to <hi>Orleans</hi> one day before the Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he was dissatisfied with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and would have had it broke, but the Prince could not consent.</p>
                  <p>Soon after, Peace being concluded, I heard that Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> was at one of her Lordships, within two Leagues of my House at <hi>Tanley;</hi> having no business of consequence at Court, I went down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of building a Lodge after the Italian mode, and to that end some days before me, sent down and Architect had undertook it.</p>
                  <p>As soon as I had reached <hi>Tanlay,</hi> all my thoughts were employed how to see the <hi>Admirale;</hi> I knew her fair, and lov'd her, and would purchase her love at what rate soever. I acquainted <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> by
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:204334:77"/>Letter of my design to see Madam <hi>de Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> she returned me answer, 'twas not yet time, and that the <hi>Admirale</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry at me, but mentioned not the occasion; but withal told me, that she was going for eight days to visit an Aunt of hers; whither, if I would take the pains to come, I might know the cause of all.</p>
                  <p>As soon as I could learn <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> was come to her Aunts, I went to her House, which was but three Leagues distant from mine. I have already told you, <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis</hi> was a kinswoman of Madam <hi>de Brions,</hi> and that she entrusted her with all her secrets, yet certain it is, the <hi>Admirale</hi> knew not that I had writ to her, or that she had answered me, or appointed me to see her.</p>
                  <p>She made me a very civil and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reception, and at her sight I was more rejoyced then I had been since the absence of Madam <hi>de Brion;</hi> she told me from whence the anger proceeded, and that its original was from the suspitions she had, I was in love with Madam <hi>D' Aumale,</hi> which were confirmed by a Letter she accused me to have writ to her; 'twas not hard to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify my self on the whole to <hi>Fontpertuis:</hi>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:204334:78"/>did it, she believed me, and assured me I was not hated.</p>
                  <p>The assurance made me hope I must be beloved; she was to be judge, the time drew nigh that our wager was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; I trusted neither so much to my love, nor the kindness the <hi>Admirale</hi> might conceive for me, as to neglect the care of making my judge favourable: there lay all my thoughts, after having taken leave of <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> and his Aunt.</p>
                  <p>My Houshold affairs, Unseasonable visits, and Letters from the Prince and <hi>Admirale,</hi> which I was obliged to answer, kept me two days from seeing <hi>Fontpertuis.</hi> You may have observed she is taking e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, has Wit and pleasant Converse, and I stood in need of her Credit. As soon as I came she complained of my neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in not seeing her all that time; her manner of looking and talking with me made me suspect her heart was smitten: I resolved to make Tryal, an found my self not deceived, she was indeed in love, I told her what I thought, she confessed it, blushing, and casting down her Eyes. In this conjuncture, I forgot the Love and Faith I owed the <hi>Admirale,</hi> and greedily
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:204334:78"/>snatching the opportunity offered, had the pleasure to seduce my Judge.</p>
                  <p>In four other visits I paid her, I had the like entertainment; I confirmed her good intentions towards me, and doubted not of her giving sentence on my side, if the <hi>Admirale</hi> would be determined by her judgement; yet sometimes I feared lest <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had too much love, which might forbid her suffering me to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and engage her for the Duke <hi>D' Aumale,</hi> who since his departure from <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> had put all those things in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, carried any likelihood of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his desires; but she satisfied me with so much sweetness and kindness, that I had no farther trouble then the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hour of judgement.</p>
                  <p>She took leave of her Aunt, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> counselling me to come thither, without asking her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and I was too much in love to neglect her counsel; I followed her next morning, and without telling the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who I was, asked for <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> who was brought to me; she told me the <hi>Admirale</hi> was in an Arbor in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; I requested her to shew me the place, she was my guide, and shewing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:204334:79"/>me the Arbor, left me within some few steps of it.</p>
                  <p>I presently went into the Arbor, and there beheld Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> asleep on a Bed of <hi>Sods.</hi> Had I till then been unsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, this sight would have made me love: The sweet composure and loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her Neck, which all appeared, strangely moved and tickled me, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant extasie spread it self through my whole body, and I was wrapt up into transports and desires that appeared to me almost like a third Heaven, to which I found all my inclinations so ready to bend, 'twas onely one way possible for me to find a happiness beyond it, for still I but lookt and durst do no more, till love made me a little bolder; and what had I not done if she had not waked? she was surprized to see me, and see her self alone with me. How <hi>D' Andelot,</hi> said she, you that are so obliged to me, how can you forget that I requested you no more to see me. Alas Madam, said I, who would not forget it when Love Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it? At this she rose up, and <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis</hi> coming in, I continued talking after that rate, not doubting but my discourse was more acceptable, then it would have been perswaded.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:204334:79"/>
                  <p> You see Madam, said I, an unhappy Man, who comes onely to know, by what justice you have condemned him to such sufferings? do you set no value on his Love and Faith, and must he hope nothing from his perseverance? Pardon me Madam, if I call you ingrateful; you deserve that Title, added I sighing, though once I thought I should never have cause to call you so. Your perfidiousness, replyed she, has smothered all I found lovely in you, I have observed your crime at large, but you have given me so little leave to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern your passion, that I have happily suppressed the Commencements of mine. Ah Madam, said I, interrupting her, that victory you will gain over your self, will cost me dear; 'tis hard for me to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of Treason, by what I love more then all the world, and judge but how it must afflict me, I cannot make you sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that Love deserves any thing! At this I asked her what was my crime, she fairly told me, and 'twas as easie for me to justifie me self by showing many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letters in the same Character which the Prince had writ to me; she began to listen, and in sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap>, was so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that I overthrew all the unjust
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:204334:80"/>suspitions she had conceived against me; our discourse ended in her gracing with an apparant joy, the finding me loving and constant, and I studied to fix her imaginations upon the consent I received from her sight and goodness, and left her not till I bore off all that Hope could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had indeed great care to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me, and seconded earnestly the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of my innocency. I saw very well what thanks she expected, and she deserved them, but poor soul, was cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of time and opportunity.</p>
                  <p>Soon after my return to <hi>Tanlay,</hi> the Duke and Dutchess of <hi>Aumale</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the sight of my Rival troubled me as much as the Dutchesses; I understood presently, that the Duke could not pass by without seeing the <hi>Admirale,</hi> and those desires made him submit to perswade the Dutchess to pass by <hi>Tanlay,</hi> which found in her a readier compliance, out of hopes her Beauty and address might at last van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish the indifference I had shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her: They stayed two days at my house, where I entertained them with all the divertisements a Countrey House could afford in the best season of the year;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:204334:80"/>since 'twas impossible for me to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with the Dutchess: she took her time when the Duke was otherwise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; I found in her discourse so much love would have ravished me, had it come from the <hi>Admirale;</hi> what would not I have given to have heard her say halfe those kind things the Dutchess did? You are pensive <hi>D' Andelot,</hi> said she to me, jogging me by the Arm, and take no care to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer me: I turned my self towards her, sighing, without thinking of it; what would you have me answer Madam, said I? recollecting my self, you cannot but think as well as I, how little I deserve the respect you give me: I could not have thought, replied she, there was a Man in the world so cruel, or who had so great a value of himself as to slight the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of one of my birth, but you have made me believe there are such, and I find it so great a torment, as nothing can counterpoyse, unless you change your thoughts. Ah Madam, cryed I, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting her, why cannot I love you; or why may not I lay open to you the secrets of a heart, I cannot give you; for if I should divide it, 'twould give you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual cause of complaint, and me no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction:

                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:204334:82"/>No, no, said she, I will have no divided heart, and had much rather it should be all Madam <hi>de Brion</hi>'s, then I have but a part.</p>
                  <p>One of the <hi>Admirales</hi> Gentlemen came to interrupt us, his message was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment the Dutchess on her arrival, and to desire her to come and spend some few days in her House; she was somewhat at a stand what to answer, when the Duke who came up to us, took the word out of her mouth, and promised on the morrow to come wait upon her; I perceived her discontent at the Dukes haste to leave <hi>Tanlay,</hi> but now she must submit, and I had too much interest to accompany her, to omit it.</p>
                  <p>The Duke and Dutchess had Lodgings appointed them, looking out upon a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race of Orange Trees (as most of the rest do) the Dutchess lay in one Chamber, and the Duke in another by the side of it.</p>
                  <p>At Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> we received the news of the preparations made to besiege <hi>Havre de grace,</hi> the English Forces were much feared, the Prince was in League with them, during the War, and it was feared upon a breach, they would send
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:204334:82"/>him considerable relief. Orders being brought to me for the march of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, I dispatched them to all places whither they were to be distributed, and I made ready my Equipage, to be in eight days at <hi>Soissons,</hi> where the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous was appointed.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi> was much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the sight of Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> and I was as much pleased to know I was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The Dutchess easily spied out my joy, and all I could do to conceal my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, was of no proof against her jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, which formed things bigger then they were.</p>
                  <p>The two moneths the <hi>Admirale</hi> and I had taken for the decision of our wager were now expired within four days; I put her in mind of it, she only blusht, and answered nothing, but her silence was a Million, my Love understood it very well. I was diligent to secure my Judges favour by that complaisance a faithful Lover should onely give to the Person he loved; but Interest changes maximes of Love and that obliged me to treat thus with <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> to whom my kindness was but policy.</p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:204334:83"/>
                  <p> There were sent from <hi>Paris</hi> to Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> two <hi>China</hi> Gowns excellently stained with little Antick Figures, which appeared the more admirable, because <hi>Europe</hi> had seen so few of them. She gave the finest to Madam <hi>D' Aumale,</hi> who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Admirale,</hi> wore hers, put it on the same day. That Evening, as we were all in the Garden, and that walking in the Serene, gave us a delight, the heats of the day had robbed us of. I coming near to <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> be sure to meet me, said she, on the <hi>Orange Terrace,</hi> I have somewhat to say to you in behalf ofâ I made her a sign to speak lower, Madam <hi>d'Aumale</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by us.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, Amorous, Zealous, and withal ill treated, talked of love with the <hi>Admirale.</hi> Will you be always cruel Madam, said he, and never pitty what I suffer; you will find much more sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in that amorous conversation, I so sincerely propose then in that indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hinders, and by its niceness, obstructs the injoyments of those pleasures love would confer, but Madam <hi>d'Andelot</hi> loves you, and can you be so insensible as you appear? These words smote her, but after having stood mute a while, Should I
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:204334:83"/>permit you, said she, to search my heard, you would find little there, contributing to your desires; your love should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Dutchess onely, she is one of the most charming persons of the World, and I will never be upbraided to have bred a disunion between you.</p>
                  <p>He would have replied, but the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirale</hi> unwilling to hear any more, called Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> who was still talking as fast of love to me, as I was assuring her, that if she knew me well, she would soon be convinced I did not deserve her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi> closing continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> it was impossible for me to have any talk with her; but my eyes spoke what my tongue could not, and hers answered me, so that I enjoyed not onely the content to know I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, but that my sufferings were shared in.</p>
                  <p>The Haut Boys and Flutes I had brought playing us some tunes, we stayed till night being pretty well spent, Supper was brought into a Pleasure-House in the Garden, and having afterwards taken some few turns about the Alleys, all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to rest, but I to expect the good
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:204334:84"/>hour <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had assigned me. All the obliging signs and glances Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> had given me, made me believe she would hasten my felicity, and that <hi>Fonpertuis</hi> had order to be the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer.</p>
                  <p>I came therefore to the appointed Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, the night was as cloudy as lovers would desire. I gingerly marched on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Admirales</hi> Lodgings, and as well as night would give me leave; methought I perceived a Woman come out, I advanced, and she came towards me. I thought I knew her by her <hi>China</hi> Gown, and her stature, but methought much more by her desires and mine, that were so pressing, they made her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand I would speak with her, and she had the goodness to hear them at the Foot of an <hi>Orange</hi> Tree adjoyning to an Arbor.</p>
                  <p>On a sudden I heard a noise on the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, and saw the Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi> passing swiftly by, we imprudently staid in the place where we were, and he perceived us, and sighing, withdrew. I was half distracted at this adventure, but much more when I discerned I was not with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Brion,</hi> but the Dutchess. I perceive
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:204334:84"/>by your surprise, said she, you thought your self happier then you are.</p>
                  <p>At that a door opened, and out came <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> but I had said so much to the Dutchess I had not a word to say to her, who strangely reproached me for that si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence she did not expect.</p>
                  <p>The Dutchess withdrew by the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, over which she came, and retired into her Chamber, much confused to think on what might happen on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, not knowing what to resolve, nor how to bear the reproaches she expected from the Duke.</p>
                  <p>He had other thoughts then to suspect it was she that I entertained so kindly on the Terrace, he was as well as I deceived by the likeness of the Gowns and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it was Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> with his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. It was that sight troubled him, and he rose as soon as it was day, impatiently waiting the <hi>Admirales</hi> rising, she stirred not till it was late, and he attributed her sleeping so long, to her last nights watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Terrace, which ranged all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Lodgings; and therefore it was an easie matter for the Duke the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess, <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> and me, to meet.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:204334:85"/>
                  <p> The Dutchess had heard what <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis</hi> said to me in the Garden, and studied to inhanse all the sweetness of that rendezvous, and had her desire. The Duke thinking the Dutchess asleep, softly passed her Chamber, and having observed some kind glances, and perhaps more imprudent signs pass between the <hi>Admirale</hi> and me, which bespake a great Union of Heart, his jealousie urged him to spy, whether I went not into Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> Chamber, who having watched longer then I thought, went to Bed onely at break of day, and rose not till an hour before Dinner.</p>
                  <p>As soon as she was up, she asked for me, and hearing I was with the Dutchess, was coming directly to her Chamber, when the Duke coming out, desired a moments audience. She was irresolute at first, but at last consented. You are onely ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me Madam, said he, and I must be the unhappy witness of an action of love represented last night on the Terrace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>D'Andelot</hi> and you. Though Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> was not disposed to mirth, what the Duke said seemed to her so full of raillery, she could not forbear laughing; that action madded him, and he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:204334:85"/>have heard her rave and be angry, then have beheld so injurious a scorn. He could not apprehend the meaning of it, and I believe had he known it, would have excused himself from acquainting the <hi>Admirale</hi> with what had hapned.</p>
                  <p>But her laughter being all the answer, the Duke could with all his complaints and reproaches obtain, she comes into the Dutchess Chamber, who asks her the cause of her mirth; but Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> could not truly tell it her. She found her intelligence false, as to my being there, for I was before gone out into the Garden, where I began to muse of the cruel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences might arise from that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to my love, if the <hi>Admirale</hi> knew it. Alass, she but too well knew all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, for having heard a noise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Terrace, she had stept into her Closet, whence she saw the Dutchess, and soon after knew me, and saw my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity at large. Till no longer able to endure the sight, she withdrew to her Bed, but the remembrance of what she had seen, so afflicted her, she could not sleep a wink, such strange thoughts it possessed her with.</p>
                  <p>One came in the morning to tell me,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:204334:86"/>the Duke desired me to come to his Chamber, but it was the Dutchess would speak with me. I imagined it was her love had formed this deceit, and would have retired, but she withheld me. Had I believed, said she, to me, that the gift I have made you of my heart, would have onely been the parent of such an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, I should have struggled hard ere I had given way to it; what has love done to you, to make you so little sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of his favors received from me? Have you so soon forgot how kind and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing they were? Must I first send for you? Or should you have first begged my sight, unless you think me so unworthy that I am bound always to be the wooer? Though you love the <hi>Admirale,</hi> you still seem lovely to me, and you shall always find me with the same amorous intentions, you thought so happily to find upon the Terrace. The Dutchess desires were very violent as you may perceive, but I willing to preserve all mine for Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> whose wager I would gladly win, was content with the reservedness, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to which they were restrained, whilst solicited by a person so beautiful and fair. She was forced to break off her
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:204334:86"/>complaints against my unconcernment, by the Dukes entrance, who found us alone. And I began as well as the Dutchess to fear some cruel effects of his resentments for the offence we had committed; but he not knowing it, our fears were soon blown over.</p>
                  <p>I met <hi>Fontpertuis</hi>

I knew well that I deserved not to be loved by Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> I had neither given sufficient testimonies of love, nor done all I ought to arrive at such happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but all my hopes lay in the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and kindness of my Judge, who now avoided my sight.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Admirale</hi> who was filled with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and disdain, looked now no more on me with the accustomed sweetness; that change made me sensible she knew all passed upon the Terrace, and I was fully convinced of it, when from one of her Gentlewomen I received this Letter.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:204334:87"/>it never had thoughts for you? But what has it done; you should affront it with so much cruelty: That heart which thought onely of you, and was decreed onely for you? But of what use are these feeble complaints and reproaches? You have affronted me, and it is a sin to forgive you: Yet could I find the least doubt of your infidelity, my grief would be allayed, and I should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the doleful constraint of never more seeing that Man I have so much loved. But alass, I saw your disloyalty, nor could ever Man be more guilty then you. You cannot now say you love, nor have any pretence to justifie your self; therefore begone immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and flie from the pretence of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Woman, can no longer endure your presence.</p>

                  <p>After having read it, I entreated her that brought it to carry an Answer, but she excused her self as being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</p>
                  <p>All her rage fell not upon me, <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis</hi> had her share, she had seen her on the Terrace with me, and that place looked suspiciously at such a time of night: She took unkindly all that <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis</hi> could alledge to her, believing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:204334:87"/>she had betrayed her, in favor of the Dutchess.</p>
                  <p>I knew not what to think, nor what to resolve in this accident, the securest way had been to speak to the <hi>Admirale,</hi> but she blasted all opportunities. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being impossible without displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her, I chose rather to be gone, and by that observance of her commands, make her sensible I still wore her Chains.</p>
                  <p>But I did not that till I had spoke with <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> showed her the Letter the <hi>Admirale</hi> had writ, and given her one in return of it: Which done, I took Horse for <hi>Tanlay,</hi> where after I had stayed two days, I went to the Rendezvous at <hi>Sois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> I lay under great vexations after my departure, though I heard my Letter had driven away most part of her suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Why should you break off a love in its infant sweetness? No, you never loved me, since you could do thus.

                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:204334:88"/>whether the Queen Mother likewise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was waited on by Madam <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You went every morning to <hi>Fecamp</hi> to give an accompt to the King what had passed that night at the Siege. I seldom followed you for fear of seeing the Dutchess, least the <hi>Admirale</hi> might have cause of complaint; but one day I could not excuse my not going, the <hi>Constable</hi> sending me. My Commission being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, I was just upon return when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> having heard of my being at <hi>Fecamp,</hi> under pretence of inquiring news from her Husband, made very heavy complaints of me. I very quietly heard them, and could not yet answer in the manner she desired. Prince <hi>Portian</hi> came luckily to take me off, and I returned to the Camp. This Prince had formerly great pretences on her heart, and it was thought he was beloved, he was still in love; but now his cares and kindnesses were not valued at a rush, I was the darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that could make no returns.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> being come some time before to <hi>Maule,</hi> informing her self of the particulars of the Siege, understood that Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> went with the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:204334:89"/>Queen; her jealousie revived her love, she feared the losing me. <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> gave me intelligence of all the <hi>Admirales</hi> thoughts, and I found my self less un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy then I thought. The same day that I assailed the Watch-Tower, which I made my self master of, I received a Letter from the <hi>Admirale</hi> which spoke these words.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>MY Anger and Resentment cannot hold out against my love, I have nothing more to upbraid you with; and could I but see you, I should think I had nothing more to desire. But is not this too kind to you? Or do you deserve this goodness? Were it not more just in me to hate you, pursuing the Counsels your unfaithfulness gives me? But alass, when I am apt to yield to that, the secret intelligences you have in spite of me, preserved in my heart, blast all these thoughts. Yet you could not expect these expressions, and therefore must think them very kind. But I demand an equivalent reprisal, and will not be refused it, tell me not that your honor and glory oppose it, I will be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both; for all should be renounced at the command of her you love. Dismiss your self then from the Siege, what you lose on the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:204334:89"/>score of glory, you shall retrieve from the pleasures of a passion, I will make happy. If you obey me not, never see me more, and suffer me to believe you prefer the sight of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> before mine.</p>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
                  <p>Never was Man in a greater plunge then I, I could not imagine which way to steer. Love offered me pleasant and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty things, but I could not consent to blemish my reputation by quitting the Siege. <hi>Saint-Cire</hi> was the first perceived the trouble I was in; since I always used his advice, I held it unfit to conceal from him the cause, who upon first hearing it, told, there needs no consultation, on this matter. You must not stir, nor can your going off, be any way justified. Stay but till the Siege be ended, and then in the name of God, go see Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> as long as you will, and in the mean time take no heed of a Womans jealousie or anger. Your Ladies will find out a return of kindness, when once their lover pleases them, and your peace will easier be made there then here, whatever Articles she have against you. <hi>Saint-Cire</hi> was a true friend, and reason counselled me to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his advice, but love would not listen to it.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:204334:90"/>
                  <p> The Treaty with the Town, which began about two hours after, eased me of my trouble, and made me determine to depart at the beginning of the night, taking along with me, onely one Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. I got to Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> on the morrow, having rid that long way post, and on the Wings of Love. Never did I find in my self so great a disposition to joy and content. I was going to see the onely person in the World I loved best, and I was sure to find her heart full of a violent Passion which I had begot there. I would not suffer her to be told I was come; but chusing rather to surprise her my self, went directly up to her Lodgings, and into her Chamber which I found open. But is it to be believed, what I there saw? Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> in the arms of a Man, and Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> as I thought, kissing him very lovingly. She perceived me, and came running towards me with an obliging air, the joy in her face dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing nothing but pleasure; but what I had seen making me contemn all she could offer me. Disloyal Lady, said I, what would you have with me? How wretched am I to have bin the witness of what I have seen. She held me by one arm, but not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:204334:90"/>able to listen to her, nor see her longer, I snatched away from her, mounted again my Horse, and taking the road towards <hi>Havre,</hi> returned to the Camp.</p>
                  <p>My melancholly was too great to be concealed. 'Twas thought to proceed, because the English had not addressed themselves to treat with me, when my Battery was neerer advanced then any other, but the true cause was never guest at, and you your self were deceived as well as others. What lamentable reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did I make on my adventure, no cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el thought nor just suspition but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to me Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> crime, and made me judge my self the most unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Man living, because I still loved her guilty as she was. Sometimes my Anger gained the day against my Love, but in few minutes, my Love again vanquished my Anger: yet I would listen to no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification she writ to me, but I sent back her Letters without opening them, and made her judge by all my proceedings that I broke off all Commerce; the time for giving judgement on our wager, was above a month expired, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have lost, but it madded me to lose by the treason of a Person I so well loved.</p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:204334:91"/>
                  <p> The Siege ended, the King you know went to <hi>Roen</hi> to be declared Major, and thither came the <hi>Admirale,</hi> whom I took no notice of, amongst all the Feasts, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings and Delights. Madam <hi>D' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> continued her endeavours to seduce a Heart I designed to keep at rest, since the Person to whom I had given it, so ill treated it, in a time when I least deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her rigor. I withstood her kindnesses best, by the care I took to shun her; that was enough to tell her I could not love, but my indifference increased her passion. Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jealousie behold all the Dutchess did to engage me, she would not yet lose me, and at last found out the secret to make me return. She nick'd the time to a hair, for I was just ready to comply with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>D' Aumale</hi>'s love, and one day more had put me quite out of her reach.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> whom she had instructed what to say to me, talked a long time with me at the <hi>Ball;</hi> at first I had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to hear her, believing her an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice in the <hi>Admirales</hi> infidelity, but at length my anger abated, and she made me consent to come and see her on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:204334:91"/>
                  <p> Madam <hi>D' Aumale</hi> who was still in hopes her Beauty would at last affect me, seeing the discourse held between me and <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis,</hi> feared something was contriving contrary to her desires, and therefore came to interrupt us, but my resolution was taken, and having promised to see the <hi>Admirale,</hi> what ever kind or endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things the Dutchess could say, drew from me no other answer then a sigh. She began to complain of my silence, and I know not how I should have justified it, had not Prince <hi>Portian</hi> come up to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, he left Madam <hi>D' Aumale</hi> no more that evening, and the company breaking up, I retired, not yet dreaming which way the <hi>Admirale</hi> would justifie her self. She had made <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> say a thousand things to me, not at all relating to the infidelity I accused her of. I thought onely to see her to make a tryal, whether there were yet in my heart any love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining for her.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow I forgot not the hour appointed. I was brought to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> and I found her to have dismissed all other business onely to entertain me; she appeared wonderful handsom, and every look had a charm, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:204334:92"/>so much was I bewitched with her Air, Action, and Carriage, that I had nothing more to desire to make me happy, but only to be perswaded of her innocence, and now we were alone. What? you will forsake me then, said she, and can you thus easily resolve to relinquish a passion begun with so much Eagerness, Fervency and Delight. Alas Madam, said I, you snatch it from me by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty wherein you leave me of your Faith: and I restore it you, said she, by an assurance I never betray'd you. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say so much to me; the Beauty and Kindness of Madam <hi>D' Aumale</hi> have made you forget what was due to my Love, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a time when I loved you, told you so, and that you were sensible of it, and this in my own house, and in my own sight. What Treasons have you not been guilty of to me? yet I forgave you, writ to you, you come and have scarce seen me, but you rudely leave me without giving me time to convince you, of the injustice of your suspicions; since my arrival, you have never come nigh me, have scarce been heard pronounce my name, nay have shun'd the very sight of me. Go, you cannot love me, ingrateful
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:204334:92"/>Man that you are: as she ended these words, I saw a Man coming in by the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set door with his sword drawn. I knew not at first what to think of it, but turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the <hi>Admirale,</hi> I could hear her cry out, See there that dangerous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val robs you of my heart; if you still love me, you will defend your self against him. I was sat with one of my Arms thrown over the back of the Chair, and in that posture surveyed this Man, whose fury had methought little terror in it; at length I thought it to be <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised, and it was she indeed, who, as Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> told me, I had under the same Masque taken for a beloved Rival, when I came from the Siege of <hi>Havre</hi> to see her.</p>
                  <p>My suspitions being thus blown over, 'twas now my part to clear those the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirale</hi> had against me. What had passed on the Terrace of Orange Trees, she could scarce forget; but now I was in love, and was loved again. it proved no hard matter to justify my self; we renewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain a fair correspondence, and <hi>Fontper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis</hi> perswaded us 'twas the best way to banish all complaints, and let old suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions give place to Love. We had no
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:204334:93"/>small Interest to believe her, and we did so.</p>
                  <p>She then proposed, giving judgement who had won the wager. At that I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> and perceived she blusht, and stood silent. I drew a good Omen from her blushes, and no longer doubted, but my happiness was neer. I beg'd her to consent to Judgement, she turned onely her Eies towards me and sighed. That answer had a charm passed sweetly unto my soul, and made me feel an unexpressible delight. <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> knowing the favourable thoughts the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirale</hi> had for me, asked both her and me, if we would stand to her judgement. Yes, yes, we will stand to it, said I, judge us. Madam <hi>Brion</hi> cryed out, it was not fair I should answer for her, without consulting her mind, and would have withstood the sentence, but I entreated her so well, that she was appeased. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> putting on the Looks and Formality of a grave Judge, with Sternness and Authority, pronounced in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ordain that Madam</hi> de Brion <hi>pay you the forfeit of the wager,</hi> said she to me, <hi>and if she fail, I condemn her never to love you
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:204334:93"/>more.</hi> 'Tis an unjust sentence, and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, said the <hi>Admirale;</hi> and to whom Madam, said I, can you appeal? who will judge with more equity then Madam <hi>Fontpertuis?</hi> I know not, answered she, but Love possibly will judge better. You may try then, said <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, but I'me of the mind his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not much differ from mine. at which she was going out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the <hi>Admirale</hi> would have staid her, but at last acepted her pretence of going to change her Habit.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> durst not now come near me, Shame, Love, and Modesty made her Blush, Sigh, and cast down her Eies; I stept to her, and reaching out my hand, she gave me hers, and looking up kindly at me, my Eies spoke to her, and she un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood them, and I had no reason to be displeased at the answer she returned me. I took notice she had some Flowers in her bosome, I snatcht at them, and with a little resistance got them; she told me I should not keep them, and I was willing to return them to the place whence I took them.</p>
                  <p>What should I say any more for, we were both in love, and well satisfied
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:204334:94"/>with one another, and our contents en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased before we ended this interview. It lasted three hours, and <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> at her return, soon perceived Love had given judgement in a manner different from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judges, since neither one party nor the other complained.</p>
                  <p>The next was yet a happier day for me, and those which followed more. 'Tis hard to pass from great sufferings to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream joy, without being discovered. The Duke <hi>D' Aumale,</hi> who observed all my actions, sooner believed my joy to proceed from my re-accommodation with the <hi>Admirale;</hi> my good fortune doubled her jealousie, and made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more melancholly and hateful. And though the Dutchess took kindly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Prince <hi>Portian</hi> talked to her of Love, yet she could not forbear loving me more then I was willing; the content she obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> and my diligence to attend and wait on her wherever she went, produced the same effects in her, my joy had done in the Duke; but I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled not my self to take notice of their disgusts, or if sometimes I did, 'twas on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take pleasure in them.</p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:204334:94"/>
                  <p> One evening coming out of the <hi>Old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> I met Madam <hi>D' Aumale</hi> in the Queens Antichamber. I would have avoided her but could not, she urged there all she could, and made use of all the obliging ways imaginable, to make me unfaithful, but I answered her like a constant man, and I retired as soon as I could, though not till Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> who came by chance into that room, perceived our parly; she grew a little jealous of it, but I soon appeased her, by promising never more to talk with the Dutchess.</p>
                  <p>Mean time <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had not forgot the sweetness of our conversation at her Aunts; she had done me great service, and thought she deserved some kindness. I saw her every time I went to the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales;</hi> I had an esteem for her, she was our Confident, and I was pleased with her, but she was not satisfied with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference; one day thinking to find Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Brion</hi> in her chamber, I met there none but <hi>Fontpertuis.</hi> Her joy at sight of me made me guess her thoughts, and I was returning to seek out the <hi>Admirale,</hi> when she stop'd me in a manner that beg'd my stay, whither would you go, said she? you know not where to sind Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:204334:95"/>
                     <hi>de Brion,</hi> and why do you fly me? I was once thought worthy of a little Love; what has changed me? I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiously served you in your passion, and do not now desire you should love me for kindness sake, onely love me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for gratitude.</p>
                  <p>Whatever <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> could urge, I continued faithful, my refusal tormented her, I could observe some signs of her anger and vexation, yet they wrought no effect on me, and I went off blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
                  <p>There had for some days before great preparations been made for Running at the Ring. 'tis so small time since you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have forgot what passed at it, and that I won one of the Rewards, which was a Picture-Case richly set with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; I destined it for Madam <hi>de Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> who at first thought it not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to take it, but at length I made her resolve to accept it. I had left it at my Lodings, and would have sent for it, but she would not let me, telling me I might leave it with <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> who would give it her at her return from the Queen: I went and brought it to <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> who imployed it to bring about a Treason, has
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:204334:95"/>since cost me a thousand sighs, and is still the cause of those torments; I cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter describe to you then by telling you, I am now as much deserving pity, as I was worthy envy when I was beloved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> having got the Picture-Case, went to Madam <hi>D' Aumales,</hi> whom she saw but seldom; yet she had the cunning so to close in with her, that speaking of his Beauty and her Wit, she passed from their Praises to the Glory that Man would possess, should be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by her till such time as the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess could no longer forbear discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing she loved me; that I ingrossed all the thoughts of her soul, and yet made no return of one, because I was in love with Madam <hi>de Brion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had the knack to prevail so well o're the Duchess judgement, that she made her believe, I no longer loved the <hi>Admirale,</hi> and that doubtless if she made but the least show of a desire of being beloved, I would make an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous return to her, utterly disingaged from the charms of her Rival.</p>
                  <p>We easily believe what pleases us, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>D' Aumale</hi> resolved to write to me, and <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> undertook to give me her
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:204334:96"/>Letter. Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> being returned from the <hi>Old Palace,</hi> asked if I had given her the Picture-Case; <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> made answer she had not seen me, the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale</hi> wondred at my neglect, but said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> gave me notice to come at the beginning of the night to Madam <hi>D' Aumales,</hi> where Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Brion</hi> would be at play, I believed her, promised to go, and at the hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, came thither: Going in, I met a servant of Madam <hi>D' Aumales,</hi> who told me her Mistress was gone forth, but that Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> and <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> were in her chamber, I went up and met <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis,</hi> who received me with such a smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling countenance, as I could not suspect of any Artifice or Deceit. I asked her where Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> was, she told me in Madam <hi>D' Aumales</hi> little Chamber, she was on a suddain troubled with a little Head-ach, and was lain down on the Bed. I went in, the Chamber was dark, and I had my mind full of the Image of what I loved, and perceived not the Treason practised against me, but committed one my self against the <hi>Admirale,</hi> and knew it not; was ever such perfidiousness
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:204334:96"/>heard of, or could any Man be made more unhappy? Y'are very much to be pittied indeed, said the Marshal of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi> laughing to have obtained such a favor from one of the finest Women of a Kingdom. I know not the Man would not have been glad to have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied your place, as scrupulous as you are to account the greatest of pleasures for an unsupportable torment. When one is in love, replied <hi>D' Andelot,</hi> we va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue not the finest Women, but think one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of those we love, and yet methinks, said the Marshal, you digested very well your kindnesses to <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> and are not so regularly faithful as you would have us believe. 'Tis true, replied <hi>D' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot,</hi> that I have not observed that max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime with her, but I was to work her to my designs, and could I better engage her to my interests, then by engaging her love. But pray proceed, said the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal, interrupting him, to tell us what you did in the little Chamber. I knew, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, Madam <hi>D' Aumale</hi> by her voice, I sighed for grief at the deceit put upon me, and was about to be gone, when <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> brought in Lights, and I saw not Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> but was alone with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:204334:97"/>the Dutchess, so many Beauties, of which I might dispose at pleasure, made my heart utterly unfaithful; and upon tryal, I found that there is sometimes as much pleasure in Infidelity, as in a true and constant Passion. I renewed again and again my Disloyalties to the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi> and my Treason began to grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to me, when there had like to have hapned a scurvy accident.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>D' Aumale</hi> came home, and wanted but little to surprise us; <hi>Fontper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis</hi> came running in afrighted and had scarce the time to say, He followed her. I hid my self behind the Bed, had I gone into the Chimney, as I was once thinking to do, I had perished either with the fire or smoak; for the Duke coming in pale and heavy, and his looks enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring him distempered, called for some fire, believing a fit of an Ague was seising on him. I knew not possibly how to get out; and Madam <hi>D' Aumale</hi> seemed to be in more trouble then I. Each of us were deliberating what was the best course to be taken, when it pleased my evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny to bring in Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> who having heard I was at the Dutchesses, came either to know the truth, or to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:204334:97"/>me in the very Act of Treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her love. She met with <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> and asking what her business was there, she replied, I come, says she, to satisfie my self, about some suspitions I have of <hi>D' Andelot,</hi> I am afraid he abuses your love; he has been a whole hour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone with the Dutchess, and is at present hid behind the Bed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Admirale</hi> upon this came in full of anger against her lover, and unable to endure the cruel injury, she believed she had received, the Dutchess began shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to apprehend her rage and resentment. <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> having carried her treachery thus far, went home to the <hi>Admirales,</hi> and left the persons concerned in no little trouble and perplexity, brought on them by her cunning and artifice.</p>
                  <p>The Duke whose Feavor augmented, not able to keep up any longer, retired into his Chamber, and went to Bed. Scarce was he gone out, but the <hi>Admirale</hi> mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously told the Dutchess she was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ill, and throwing her self upon the Bed, pretending to have a pain at heart, she leaned her head towards my side, and drawing the Curtain, gave me such fierce looks as spoke a thousand things to me,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:204334:98"/>without uttering a word; when on a sudden, her first dissembled grief, became a true one, and I perceived her swound away.</p>
                  <p>At that fight, without premeditating what might happen, I gave so grievous a shout, that almost all the house came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber, I came out from behind the Bed, and endeavored to assist her what I could. My sight had much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to her swouning, but the Picture Case which <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had without my knowledge, given on my behalf to the Dutchess, was that compleated it; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>D' Aumale</hi> chanced to have that Case in her Pocket, and it was faln upon the Bed. The <hi>Admirale</hi> by chance laid her hand upon it, and looking to see what it was, knew it, and presently imagined, that either I had given it the Dutchess, or that it was dropt out of my Pocket, whilst I was tumbling with her on the Bed.</p>
                  <p>The Duke returns to the Chamber, my sight amazes him, and being jealous of both, he knew not which to reproach, his Wife, or the <hi>Admirale,</hi> who was long before she recovered out of her swound. I took her by one of her hands, spoke
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:204334:98"/>to her; she at last opened her eyes, and seeing me, turned them towards the Duke, on whom, she kept them a good while fixt. The Duke could not imagine what to make of this adventure, there was a secret in Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which he would have given any thing in the World to discover.</p>
                  <p>The Picture Case which he knew, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied his desire, and he thence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the cause of the <hi>Admirales</hi> sudden grief, and the Dutchess confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet he could not clear all the doubts his heart mustered up, touching his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and his Love; neither by it, nor by the convincing knowledge he had of his Dutchess love for me, and his amorance, I enjoyed all the <hi>Admirales</hi> affection, not able therefore to stay there any longer, he retired into his Chamber.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Admirale</hi> restrained her Passion, and gave me not a reproaching word, but she ordered me to be gone with all the authority of a commanding Mistress. Madam <hi>D' Aumales</hi> eyes requested my stay, and seemed to entreat they might be preferred before Madam <hi>de Brions,</hi> but Love gained the day over Infidelity. I repented my crime, and went away more
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:204334:99"/>in love with the <hi>Admirale,</hi> then I had ever been before.</p>
                  <p>Soon after I was gone, she retired to her Lodgings, not without easing some of her fury on Madam <hi>D' Aumale;</hi> who not caring at what rate she gained my love, was little troubled at the discontent of her rival. <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> glad at this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, added new Treasons to them, by telling Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> I had given the Picture Case to the Dutchess: That our correspondence was setled, and that I had received a Letter from Madam <hi>D' Aumale,</hi> which she had cunningly, and without suspition got from me.</p>
                  <p>All these apparent Truths, such exact Reasons of Suspitions, and the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> inspired into the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi> made her resolve never to love me more, but to abandon me to my incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, and leave me master of the Dutchess heart, which I could not accept. I was guilty, but still I loved, I would fain have been pardoned, and endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all I could, to deserve that pardon by a sincere and lasting repentance, which I had the better hopes of, because I believed the <hi>Admirale</hi> could not refuse it to that love and tenderness she once had for me.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:204334:99"/>
                  <p> We were in this condition when the King left <hi>Rouen.</hi> I have done all I could since to regain the <hi>Admirales</hi> good will, but cannot effect it. The Progress of the Court to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> not requiring my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, I stayed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and knowing that the Duke and Dutchess <hi>D' Aumale,</hi> the <hi>Admirale, de Brion,</hi> and Prince <hi>Portian,</hi> went to <hi>Fontainbleau.</hi> I am come hither either to disturb their content, or with hopes so firmly to establish my self in the kindness and affection of the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi> that nothing may hereafter ruine me. But I have yet been deceived in my hopes; Madam <hi>D' Aumale</hi> still loves me, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pises Prince <hi>Portian</hi> who loves her so well. The Duke continues my rival, I am fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful least he should be happy, and the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirale</hi> adds to my fear, by the obliging manner in which she treats the Duke; and I am the more unhappy, because I cannot renounce my love, nor ever hope to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> to be touched with what I suffer, or to restore me to the same place I once possest in her heart.</p>
                  <p>Your condition is not so bad as you think, said the Marshal <hi>de Montmorency</hi> to <hi>D' Andelot,</hi> I know the very thoughts of the <hi>Admirales</hi> Soul, and am confident she
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:204334:100"/>preserves very kind ones for you, but you must deserve them. What would you have me do to be happy, said <hi>D' Andelot.</hi> Me thinks it is no hard task, replied the Marshal, and were it my case, I would sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise the <hi>Admirale</hi> in her Chamber, cast my self at her feet, acknowledge my crime, refer my self to her for punishment, joyn sighs and tears to my repentance, promise never more to see Madam <hi>D' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> and in short, not part from her, till I were as much beloved as I loved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>D' Andelot</hi> took the Marshal's counsel (who was a notable man in affairs of love, and whose story shall follow <hi>D' Andelots</hi>) he surprised the <hi>Admirale,</hi> he sighed, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, till his grief made her relent; and that soon turned into love, and that love became as kind, as passionate, and as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as ever it had been before.</p>
                  <p>The Dutchess <hi>D' Aumale</hi> was quite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate, to have thus utterly lost all hopes of <hi>D' Andelot,</hi> Prince <hi>Portian</hi> underrook to comfort her; but he succeeded not at first, but since Love and Patience over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greatest difficulties, it need not be wondered at, if they vanquish those which would oppose their Felicity.</p>

               <head>BÆ²SSY D' AMBOYSE.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Battel of <hi>Jarnac</hi> was fought under the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the IX., the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> chief of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,</hi> lost there his life, Admiral <hi>Chatillon</hi> rallied the ruines of the broken Army, and put his Brother <hi>D' Andelot</hi> into <hi>Cognac,</hi> who by his valor made <hi>Monsteurs</hi> Victory fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. 'Twas in this Field <hi>Bussy D' Amboyse</hi> began to give such large assurances of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:204334:101"/>what he one day would be, that <hi>Monsieur,</hi> though he loved him not, had the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity to praise him at the head of the whole Army.</p>
               <p>War had its time to revenge Hate and sustain Authority; and Love must have his to create Pleasures for those who had the happiness to reach them, and Pains and Sufferings for who were destined to be miserable.</p>
               <p>Three months after this Battle, <hi>Bussy</hi> conceived a design of gaining an esteem in the heart of the Widow to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal <hi>de St. Andre,</hi> the number of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers was great, he had reason to think his Rivals dangerous, but <hi>Bussy</hi> feared nothing from Mankind, and hoped all things from his Merit and his Love.</p>
               <p>'Twas with the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> and <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroles,</hi> the favourite of <hi>Monsieur,</hi> that he was to dispute the heart of the Lady <hi>Mareshalle;</hi> There were many other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, but these two were the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bussy</hi> tries all imaginable ways to please, he makes addresses to the Lady <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shale,</hi> he observes she delights in them, he continues them, he becomes both pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and necessary, and makes himself be
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:204334:101"/>desired; his Rivals believed they had reason to be jealous of him, and he took little care to perswade them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>He durst not speak for a long time of his Love, but at last ashamed of her si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he breaks it. He goes into the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Mareshales</hi> Chamber, at a time she would not be seen. Mr. Lover, who let you in? said she, with a severe cast of her Eye; return immediately: He feared he had displeased her, that fear was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Lady, she perceived it, and recalled him, who was withdrawing, not expecting this return, I came to tell you Madam, said he, that I am in love, you have put it into my heart, which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might have attempted in vain; I comply with delight to all it inspires, 'tis very tender, and what will not you lose by being unsensible? but Madam, I see you are angry, continued he, perceiving she turned her Eies towards him, in a manner forbidding despair.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mareshale</hi> was angry with her self, that she had cast so kind a glance at <hi>Bussy.</hi> Never see me more, said she, I cannot endure you; Take away my Love, and I consent, said he, interrupting her, I have
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:204334:102"/>nothing to give you, nor nothing to take away, replyed she, but once more I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid you my sight. <hi>Bussy</hi> goes forth just at the same time that <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was told she was not to be seen; he believed <hi>Bussy</hi> happy, and that belief increas'd his grief without diminishing his Love. The Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> jealous and impatient, and who found no pleasure in loving alone, prays the Lady <hi>Mareshale</hi> to bear him company, but her heart beginning to be engaged, received coldly the Dukes proposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was the handsomest, and best proportioned Man in all the Court; yet his Love making no progress, he would at least give some trouble to his Rivals, he entreats <hi>Monsieur</hi> to feign to love the <hi>Mareshale. Bussy</hi> who had preserved some intelligence with <hi>Chateauneuf,</hi> let her know that she was about to lose <hi>Monsieurs</hi> heart, if she found not a quick way to withhold it. Assoon as she saw <hi>Monsieur,</hi> she fills his Ears with reproaches and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, he justifies his Love and Fidelity, and promises no more to see the <hi>Mareshale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bussy</hi> durst not go near her, and <hi>Ligne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roles</hi> sharply repaid the jealousie he had given him.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:204334:102"/>
               <p> The Court was at <hi>Paris</hi> but preparing for a Progress to <hi>Blois,</hi> where the Peace lately made with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> was to be Signed, and the Marriage Treated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Madame,</hi> and the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> knowing that she would not go this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, pressed the obtaining some favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable answer, but she declared for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there was only observed in her, more civility towards the Duke, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance for <hi>Ligneroles;</hi> the Dukes Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly rejoyced <hi>Bussy,</hi> but <hi>Ligneroles</hi> joy made him almost despair.</p>
               <p>The King was two days at <hi>St. Germains</hi> with <hi>Monsieur</hi> and a very small number of Courtiers. <hi>Ligneroles</hi> entertaining the King, was so indiscreet to let fall some words, made him suspect that the secret of the Marriage of <hi>Madam</hi> with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> was not unknown to him; <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi> kept nothing from him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought it was not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but he had discovered all the design. The King, who knew best the Art of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling of any Prince in the world, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly interrupts him, by asking whither it was true that he loved the Lady <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reshale,</hi> as much as some would perswade
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:204334:103"/>him, <hi>Ligneroles</hi> acknowledged that he did Love, but was not beloved. The King being in Bed, caused <hi>Monsieur</hi> to be called, with whom he grew so angry that he made him consent to the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> and promise that he would not speak to him of it, but nothing can be kept concealed from what we love; the King returns to <hi>Paris, Monsieur</hi> goes to visit <hi>Chasteauneuf,</hi> she perceives his sadness, he suffered her Solicite a long time before he let her know the cause, and knowing it, she condoled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came partner in his grief without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting <hi>Ligneroles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King gave a Ball at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> the <hi>Mareshale</hi> takes out <hi>Ligneroles</hi> to dance. <hi>Bussy</hi> believed her carriage not indifferent towards him, and that which doubled his grief and his jealousie, was, that she never so much as cast her Eies on himself.</p>
               <p>He comes to <hi>Chasteauneuf</hi> who had something to say to him, the <hi>Mareshale</hi> knew he had loved her, she feared lest Love should be renewed between them, and <hi>Chasteauneuf</hi> perhaps found an easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in it, to which <hi>Bussy</hi> agreed not.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:204334:103"/>
               <p> His heart no longer able to bear the <hi>Mareshales</hi> disdain, which he believed was caused by her kindness to <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> he resolved to challenge him.</p>
               <p>The friendship of <hi>Bussy</hi> with <hi>Grillon</hi> was begun some few days before, for he not enduring to live without Love in so gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant a Court, found Madam <hi>Bonneval</hi> the most proper to beget it in him; she was a very well made person, but her Manners were more engaging then her Beauty; <hi>Grillon</hi> follows her in all places, she perceives it, but forbids him not to follow her. What would you have with me <hi>Grillon?</hi> said she, one evening in the Queens Closet; All that should be given to those love well, <hi>Madam</hi> answered he; the King who overheard it, began to laugh; Madam <hi>de Bonnevall</hi> was vexed, and <hi>Grillon</hi> somewhat abashed: from that day forward, she was very rigorous to him; he complained to <hi>Bussy,</hi> who was beloved without knowing it. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to serve him with Madam <hi>Bonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,</hi> and without any longer delaying the effects of his promise, that very day he goes to her, and finding her alone; Who knows not, says he, that you are lovely, and that your Eies have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:204334:104"/>secret of inchanting Hearts? but I was ignorant till now, that to so many Excellencies and so many Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are joyned such strange cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that the pleasure of seeing you has for its certain consequence such mighty sufferings, 'Tis that I come to complain of, continued he, (looking on her with and Eye full of Love without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny design) but I have some counsel to give you, will you receive it? continue I beseech you, the chains of those which adore you, 'twill be no great favour done them; 'tis so great a misery to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that it becomes natural to wish for happiness: Speak Madam, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to say, and give some joy to the unhappy <hi>Grillon,</hi> when <hi>Madame</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steauneuf</hi> came in, <hi>Bussy</hi> conceiving he could not now continue the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had begun, went and found out <hi>Grillon,</hi> and gave him an account of what he had said.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> believed not at all that it was on <hi>Grillons</hi> part she had heard those loving words, but on his own; she was resolved to have kindly answered <hi>Bussy;</hi> had not <hi>Madame</hi> come in. He was the Man of all the world she most desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:204334:104"/>to engage; she loved him, and she believed her self Beautiful enough to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Love in him. This easily perswaded her not to doubt, but it was the design of his heart, and not being capable of a cruel thought towards him, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over being perswaded it might produce a good effect, to spare him any farther trouble, She sent him this Note next Morning.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <p>LOve me, and tell me so, what should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 068 you? And to let you see I am more lovely then you think, look here what Chains I command you to carry.</p>

               </floatingText>
               <p>This Note was without superscription, and inclosed a Bracelet of Hair of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable weaving. <hi>Bussy</hi> rejoyced he had so well succeeded in his amorous Embassie, as much as he would have grieved, had he known the tender goodness of Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> was addressed to himself, and not to <hi>Grillon;</hi> who was much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, when <hi>Bussy</hi> gave him both the one and the other, he applied to himself all the sweetness was in that Note, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Bracelet as a favor, so much more worthy, because less expected: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:204334:105"/>himself happy, by an adventure had made him despair, had he known the truth of it. But how should he come to learn it, if Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> without appearing, surprised at so ill tuned an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, does put on so cunning a disguise that <hi>Grillon</hi> cannot know her thoughts; yet she cannot digest the affront, it is a touch too sensible for Ladies, and they never pardon the slighting of their Beauty.</p>
               <p>Let <hi>Bussy</hi> serve for example, Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> stifles all the love she had for him, and onely meditates revenge; she alters not her behavior towards him, but endeavors to discover the cause of his refusal. What is often said of love is true, it cannot be long kept secret. Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> lets nothing scape may serve to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the revenge as she designs. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets and comments upon the Actions, the Looks, the Words of <hi>Bussy,</hi> and draws thence Suspitions, which become Truths, and tell her he is in love. One day she was with the Lady <hi>Mareshale,</hi> when <hi>Bussy</hi> comes there, but his carriage seemed so unconcerned, that none but Madam <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neval</hi> could have divined his thoughts. Not able long to contain, he throws on
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:204334:105"/>the <hi>Mareshale</hi> such amorous glances, that Madam <hi>Bonneval</hi> perceived them, though he durst not sigh so loud as to be heard: She discovered love in the eyes of <hi>Bussy,</hi> and was enraged, it was not all for her; by all these signs, she knew he was deeply intangled And the more ingenuously to advance her revenge, she doubles her appearances of Friendship, and under the false resemblances of a complacent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, which she affected, successfully labors to create confidences with the <hi>Mareshale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bussy</hi> had designed to fight <hi>Ligneroles</hi> on the first occasion presented; on the morrow one brake forth, the King would speak with him, he loved him, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a good issue of any dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, if entrusted to him. The King comes into his Closet, where he was told he attended, and proposed the killing of <hi>Ligneroles.</hi> Can you have any esteem for me Sir, answered <hi>Bussy,</hi> and make choice of me to rid you of <hi>Ligneroles</hi> by unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some ways. Ah <hi>Bussy,</hi> said the King, what will not any Man undertake to revenge himself of a beloved Rival, and to sustain the Interest of his King, when he finds in his own Courage a security for the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:204334:106"/>execution, and that his Soveraign abbets the action. But what ever the King could say, or promise, he could not make <hi>Bussy</hi> consent to his desires. In this des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate affair, he becomes the friend of <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> and chuses rather to expose himself to the Kings anger, by represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the merits of his Rival, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he might one day render him, then to oblige his revenge at the expence of his honor and reputation. The King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, ill satisfied with <hi>Bussy</hi>'s generous thoughts; but in his Soul approved what he seemed to condemn; yet forbidding him upon pain of death, once to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Proposition he had made him. <hi>Bussy</hi> answers nothing and withdraws.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> who had grown into great confidences with the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> (though not such secret ones as <hi>la Hermite,</hi> who was one of her attendants) tells her that one of her people had seen <hi>Bussy</hi> go to <hi>Chateauneuf's,</hi> but she drew false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures from this visit, <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> had sent for <hi>Bussy</hi> to come to her Lodgings, to tell him the design the King had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> believing he knew it not. She loved <hi>Bussy,</hi> and the love he had for the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> hindred him from answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:204334:106"/>her love. She believed <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was beloved, and that by preserving his life, <hi>Bussy</hi> might lose the hopes of ever affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lady <hi>Mareshale,</hi> and then she flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her self he might return to her. Directed by such prudent policy, she told him the cause of <hi>Ligneroles</hi> disgrace, as she had learnt it from <hi>Monsieur,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to him, that it was more glorious to overcome a Rival by generous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, and by advertising him his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction was designed, then to triumph over his evil Fortune, by concealing from him, that the Kings most cruel resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ready to fall upon him. <hi>Bussy</hi> hears all <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> would say on this subject, without promising any thing, save onely to be secret in his having learnt it of her. He perceived by her carriage, that she desired an entertainment like to those they had had together in the time they loved; but that time was passed, love had disposed of <hi>Bussy</hi>'s heart, in favor of the <hi>Mareshale;</hi> and though <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> were one of the fairest persons of <hi>France,</hi> and employed now all her charms which had formerly seemed so alluring; and let him now hear a thousand flattering and pleasant things, he still remained constant,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:204334:107"/>and parted from her without giving the least reason to be reproached, as to his love.</p>
               <p>Understanding that <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was in the Garden of the <hi>Hostel</hi> of <hi>Soissons,</hi> he goes thither; and after having drawn him off some paces from the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> who was with Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> I was resolved yesterday to kill you as a Rival, whose happiness made me despair, said <hi>Bussy</hi> to him, to day I would endeavor to preserve you as an honest, but unhappy Man, who have, doubtless, neither deserved death by the cruel maximes of State, nor the particular hate of the King. I should have received you as an enemy fit to be feared, answered <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> but I dread you more with the merit wherewith now you appear, and if possible, I would ow you nothing. In vain I examine and search my self, in what point I can be guilty. You are not inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, replied <hi>Bussy,</hi> since you have let the King perceive you were not ignorant, that the marriage of <hi>Madame,</hi> and the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> was onely an ingenuous pretext, the more securely to ruine the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> The silence and confusion of <hi>Ligneroles</hi> accused him, and he had now
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:204334:107"/>no hopes but in <hi>Monsieurs</hi> Protection, he could not believe himself forsaken by him, but <hi>Bussy</hi> assured him of it. My crime is, having spoken, says he, at length, but I had rather die, then doubt of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieurs</hi> friendship, he knows not my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction is resolved; for he who never kept secret from me, would not have concealed a design against my life.</p>
               <p>Whatever <hi>Bussy</hi> could alledge, he would not take the advise he gave him not to go this progress, nor take the ways to secure himself he offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ligneroles</hi> spoke after this of the Lady <hi>Mareshale.</hi> The esteem I have for you, said he, hinders me from concealing the estate wherein my love, and services have put me with her, I love her and she knows it. I have sighed, I have complained, and all the fruit I have gathered from all this, is the pleasure to see my self hopeless; you, believed there were strong ties of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness between us, and it was my interest not to disabuse you, she wanted one of the family to keep up her affairs with <hi>Monsieur.</hi> I was capable of serving her, and you took for love, that assiduity she permitted me, rather to give her an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of my Negations, then to give me
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:204334:108"/>marks of her goodness. Ah <hi>Bussy,</hi> must I tell it you, continued <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> for you onely is reserved the happiness to affect her Soul, and she sees you not, onely for fear of loving you too much. That fear should be a glory and pleasure to you, Proceded he, sighing, what would not I do to inspire the like? But you would be unfortunate, if such a thing were which is, what I cannot desire at such a price after that you have now done. Are you so generous, replied <hi>Bussy,</hi> to tell your Rival in good earnest, that he is not hated? I am unhappy enough to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, for not being loved, said <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> interrupting, and that I am in danger of losing my life, and need not be suspected to want sincerity towards the Man I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem most of all the World.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mareshale</hi> who observed them, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Discourse might end in a quarrel, but her apprehensions changed subject, when she beheld them embrace.</p>
               <p>Her suspicions of <hi>Bussy</hi> increased, she was jealous of <hi>Chateauneuf:</hi> Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences at the Ball, and the impressions of his visiting her, much perplexed her mind; and besides that, he parted from <hi>Ligneroles</hi> more like a Friend then a Rival.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:204334:108"/>What then, had she not reason to fear? Ladies would lose nothing; they believe the number of their lovers is a mark of their merit, and an increase of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. I say not the <hi>Mareshale</hi> had these thoughts, but she could not look upon the semblances of his change, but as an injury in his judgment. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by their actions they were become Friends, and that <hi>Bussy</hi> had yielded to <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> all the pretentions he had on her heart, she seemed to have more scorn for <hi>Bussy,</hi> and more fierceness for <hi>Ligne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roles,</hi> when they met the Queen, who soon after went to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and the <hi>Mareshale</hi> with her.</p>
               <p>These Rivals went together from the <hi>Hostel de Soissons. Ligneroles</hi> was assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by four unknown men, who cryed out to <hi>Bussy,</hi> they would have onely the life of <hi>Ligneroles;</hi> but all the answer he gave, was to let them know, it was hard to take that from a man he defended. <hi>Ligneroles</hi> opposed his courage to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies numbers, and conjured <hi>Bussy</hi> to let him perish alone, and not run the hazard of losing his life, either by these Assa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, or by the anger of the King, who would not want advice of the assistance he
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:204334:109"/>gave him: <hi>Bussy</hi> impatiently endured what <hi>Ligneroles</hi> said, and parry'd most part of the thrusts made at him. The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> chancing, at this moment, to pass by, took their part; the four men yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the courage and constancy of the Duke, <hi>Bussy</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles;</hi> they fled in disorder, some of them wounded, and one of them was taken by <hi>Bussy</hi>'s servants, whom <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> let go against the Dukes mind, not doubting, but from him, might be learned the first authors of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. But <hi>Bussy</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, commanded by the King, drew off the Duke from those suspicions he might have had, by feigning a Family quarrel which they would revenge. This assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate made a great noise, and <hi>Monsieur</hi> talked publick, That he made <hi>Ligneroles</hi> case his own, but in private he said other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: He knew from whence the blow came, and <hi>Dugua</hi> who was beginning to enter into his favor, and who was gained by the King, had made him approve the design conceived for the killing <hi>Ligne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roles</hi> at his coming out of the Gardens of <hi>Soissons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King who was violent in the first eruptions of his anger, was about to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:204334:109"/>the arresting of <hi>Bussy</hi> for assisting <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> and whom he believed had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his secret; but the esteem he had for him, banished this design of revenge.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had no share in the Kings resentments, not being at all faulty: <hi>Bussy</hi> came that Evening to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and saw the King, who received him with many praises for the action he had done, though he did not approve it; but he understood dissimulation. On the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>Bussy</hi> sent to request of the Lady <hi>Mareshale,</hi> he might have the honor to kiss her hands, he had never spoke to her since she had forbid him seeing her. She was full of anger, and of shame, and could not prevail over her heart, to bring it to that indifference she desired, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her agreement to <hi>Bussy</hi>'s request.</p>
               <p>Just as her answer was brought to him, <hi>Ligneroles</hi> came into his Chamber, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it, and assured him he would omit nothing possible for him to do, to procure him an enterview with the <hi>Mareshale.</hi> It is hard to be obliged for such a kindness to a Rival, but <hi>Bussy</hi> was constrained to it. <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was still of the same mind not to retire from Court; and <hi>Bussy</hi> argued hard against a resolution, which had no
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:204334:110"/>other foundation then <hi>Monsieurs</hi> Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, on which he had much less reason to confide, then on a provident and quick withdrawing, which was the onely way to secure him. <hi>Ligneroles</hi> came to the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> and at first pleaded in vain on <hi>Bussy</hi>'s behalf, but at last she consented to see him. She after asked him, who were those had assaulted him; he would not tell her the secret, but he told her that without <hi>Bussy</hi>'s assistance he had been in very great danger, and that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had likewise defended him.</p>
               <p>It was agreed between them, that <hi>Bussy</hi> should come after Supper, and that on condition he brought him, which he did. She was beginning to be undrest, and desired him to be present at their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, to deprive <hi>Bussy</hi> of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he might find in seeing and discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her alone, which <hi>Bussy</hi> feared; but <hi>Ligneroles</hi> who would not be generous by halfs, civilly retired, and by his retreat left him full liberty to see, speak, and be heard. She went for a moment into the Alcove to change her shift, whilst <hi>Bussy</hi> staid looking on a Picture of a Mignon love which endeavored to climb to the top of a Rock, he drew a Pencil out of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:204334:110"/>his Pocket to write, <hi>I shall arrive,</hi> when the <hi>Mareshale</hi> gave a great shriek, and came running almost naked into his arms. Such a sight would certainly affect one indifferent, what then could be <hi>Bussy</hi>'s thoughts who was in love. He stopt her, asking the cause of her fright, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to reassure her; but he perceived she swounded, and was in condition to create extasies of love: So that <hi>Bussy</hi> suckt in pleasures at his eyes, their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was to him obliging and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they showed him curious things; it is impossible to express the sweet and tender motions of his Soul, love onely can do it; but love is discreet, and tells not all it feels. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> who was as fraid as her Lady, was fled to call other Maids to her assistance, whilst <hi>Bussy</hi> endeavored to bring her to her self.</p>
               <p>They entred readily into the Chamber, followed by <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> who being got onely to the Stairs foot, ran back in hast to know the reason of the noise he heard. How was he surprised, How astonished, And how afflicted, all at once, to see the <hi>Mareshale</hi> in the arms of one she loved? What jealous thoughts did not this sight inspire him with? He believed himself
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:204334:111"/>unhappy, but, what thought he not of the happiness of his Rival? Yet those thoughts gave place to others more sad and grievous, when he perceived that all <hi>Bussy</hi>'s trouble proceeded from the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shales</hi> swounding. They put her in Bed, and soon after she opened her eyes, and her fright being allayed, <hi>Ligneroles</hi> and he withdrew. The <hi>Mareshale</hi> had as was well known a strong natural antipathy against Spiders, of which she could tell no cause; she then saw one on the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and saved her self whereever she could, and <hi>L'Hermite</hi> sharing in her Mistress fright, fled as I said before.</p>
               <p>On the morrow <hi>Bussy</hi> returned with design to see her, but the shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion wherein she was to be seen, in a condition so contrary to Modesty, made her resolve to refuse a pleasure, she would gladly have received, under pretence of not being well recovered from her fright.</p>
               <p>He divined one part of her thoughts, but unwilling to be a second time obliged to <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> and trusting in <hi>Neufville,</hi> he gave him Commission to let the <hi>Mareshale</hi> know he had some important business to discourse with her. <hi>Neufville</hi> did it, but not being happy in serving his Friend, he
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:204334:111"/>in vain attempted to perswade her, she ought to hear what <hi>Bussy</hi> had to say to her.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Bussy</hi> was to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, he had not onely the pangs of his love, and the cruelties of the <hi>Mareshale</hi> to groan under, but must likewise endure all that grief caused by <hi>Ligneroles</hi> his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> assisted by the Counsels of Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> who he had formerly loved, and who was still his friend, neglected nothing he thought might make him be beloved. This Prince was young, brave, ambitious, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, every way lovely and deserving; but to what end were all these great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, whilst he was not beloved; and yet made all his happiness consist in the being so.</p>
               <p>But in a Conference he had, his love changes object; it was with his Uncle, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who having already broke off the Match between <hi>Madame,</hi> and the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> would do the like with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and by his credit with Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Medices,</hi> marry her to his Nephew. The love he had for the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> withstood this great
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:204334:112"/>Fortune, but the interest of his family, and his ambition made him comply with what was desired. He began therefore in more steddy manner, to fix his thoughts on <hi>Madame,</hi> and considering her as the daughter of a great King, and whose Wit and Beauty might pleasantly revenge him of the rigors of his Mistress, he steered all his love and cares towards her. This change surprised Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> and afflicted not at all the <hi>Mareshale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grillons</hi> Constancy was yet unhappy, Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> was perplexed and melancholly, she had laid designs which she could not execute, and <hi>Grillon</hi> must suffer for it. He was impatient, and would have love immediately returned for love, and the refusing him with any sharpness, the recompence he requested, was enough to make him believe there was none to give. Sometimes anger and suspition tempted him to inconstancy, but when he thought to love no longer, one glance of Madam <hi>de Bonnevals</hi> recalled him to his Chains.</p>
               <p>She thought on nothing but revenge on <hi>Bussy,</hi> for being in love with the <hi>Mareshale.</hi> She knew almost all passed in her heart, her inclination for <hi>Bussy</hi> was no secret to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:204334:112"/>her, but she strove to lessen it by her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and counsels, and by the cunning she had to possess her with the thoughts of his love to <hi>Chateauneuf.</hi> In sum, she made her so ashamed of her thoughts, that the <hi>Mareshale</hi> could not have kept them alive, had she not been strongly prepossessed with the worth and honesty of <hi>Bussy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ligneroles</hi> had onely some shows of <hi>Monsieurs</hi> favor, <hi>Dugua</hi> had the substance, whose subtile spirit, raised so many quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and caused so many disorders. Yet so cunningly was his disgrace concealed, that he could never discover, whether he had consented to his death; the same signs of trust and friendship still appeared, but all those signs were onely kept up like false lights to deceive him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bussy</hi> not able to disabuse him, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Grillon,</hi> very rarely left him.</p>
               <p>Beauty, good Men, Birth, and love in <hi>Monsieur,</hi> could not banish from <hi>Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf</hi> the Passion she had for <hi>Bussy,</hi> she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied the <hi>Mareshales</hi> happiness, and the difficulty she foresaw, would be found in depriving her of her lover, strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased her desire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neufville</hi> not having succeeded with the <hi>Mareshale, Bussy</hi> resolved himself to speak
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:204334:113"/>to her, and his attempt was happy. She was ready to go forth, but her confusion was so great at the sight of <hi>Bussy,</hi> that she would have drawn back into her Closet; but he placing himself before her in a Suppliant, and respectful posture; Stay Madam, said he, I come not to speak of my love, but of <hi>Ligneroles.</hi> You know him, continued he, seeing she stayed to hear him, and you know he loves you. A little of your pitty would be a great allay of those cruel sufferings his Passion torments him with, and I shall be happy in obtaining what I request for him. The <hi>Mareshale</hi> blusht with anger at this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Bussyes,</hi> not doubting but he had given over loving her, but willing to conceal her concernment. You shall not obtain what you pretend from me, replied she, I find I have no disposition to do good, and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> is to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, if he accounts upon any favorable thoughts. I have none, my heart is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to whatever I will, and I fear not its betraying the interests of my glory, to take part with those of my love: Madam, replied he, Treason is easily pardoned when we find a sweetness in being betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and since you will find a great deal
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:204334:113"/>in this crime; if your heart commit it, you will, without doubt, be induced to pardon the fault, by the pleasure you will receive, in loving, and being beloved. Remember then <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> Madam, he is unhappy without deserving it; he has a tender and violent Passion, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not communicate to what he loves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his destruction is resolved. I come to tell you of it, who should have been the minister of the Kings revenge, he would have obliged me to have killed him; and <hi>Monsieur</hi> has resigned him to those cruel Reasons of State, may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly produce effects dismal to all <hi>France;</hi> it is not from him I speak this, he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant I prest to a sight of you; nor durst I have done it for my self, but I thought I could not neglect serving him, without leaving my self liable to just reproach; he had already been lost without the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> gave him. Say without yours, said the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, and fear not I shall value you too much: That which you tell me, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises me not without cause, and I should hardly believe all you have said, were I not well perswaded of your sincerity; but what can I do for <hi>Ligneroles?</hi> I have
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:204334:114"/>not any power; you have an absolute one over his heart, replyed <hi>Bussy,</hi> and the Commands of a Person beloved may gain from him, what neither the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels nor Prayers of a friend can hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to do. Employ your Beauty to oblige him not to go this progress, and let him know, he has now no part in <hi>Monsieur,</hi> and that his death is unavoidable, if he withdraw not from Court. This Madam is all that I have to say, can you now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of me, or are you at all troubled to have heard me? She was about to answer when <hi>Ligneroles</hi> entred, from whom she concealed not the least circumstance of what had been said to her. My destiny's very strange, said <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> to find more succor from a Rival, then from the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of a Man I have so long served, or from the heart of a Mistress I have so dearly loved. No Madam, I deserve not your love, one alone is worthy of it, if any can be, his thoughts are so Noble and Virtuous, his Love so excelling, his Heart so great, he possesses all qualities required in a true brave Man, and all that the most delicate Lady can desire in a Lover; Therefore love <hi>Bussy,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he sighing. Hold, said <hi>Bussy,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:204334:114"/>your indiscretion ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mareshale</hi> could not enough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Character of these two Lovers; <hi>Bussy</hi> refused to rid himself of <hi>Lignero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi> it was as much as his life was worth to let scape the secret entrusted him by the King, he believed it not important, not enough to make Honour its sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he advised <hi>Ligneroles</hi> of the designs against him, and defended him after that against those the King sent to take away his life. He speaks of the Love of <hi>Ligne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roles,</hi> and not only endeavors to serve him as a friend, but essays to make him be beloved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ligneroles</hi> soul yields not in greatness to <hi>Bussy</hi>'s, he declares himself unworthy of his concern for him, praises his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and pronounces him alone worthy of Love. The <hi>Mareshale</hi> seeing <hi>Bussy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to withdraw; stay, said she, and be witness, I will spare nothing to save <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> but all her goodness proved in vain, he let her know he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse to die out of too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in <hi>Monsieurs</hi> friendship, then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly accuse him by his flight of having consented to his death. <hi>Bussy</hi> joyned
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:204334:115"/>his Counsels and Reasons to the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shales,</hi> but he remained firm in his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of going the progressâª The next day the King hunted with the Queen, <hi>Madame,</hi> and several other Ladies, all on horseback. After having for some time chaced an Hare, which the Dogs eat, the King had a desire to take some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with a Ferret, saying, He would kill all came out of their Buries. These words were observed by the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and Politicians, and they drew judicious conjectures from his humour, which might have served to secure them against those cruelties acted soon after upon them, but they suffered themselves to be deceived by Soveraign Faith, by the cunning of <hi>Katherine de Medices,</hi> and by the Honours and Dignities they received.</p>
               <p>At this Chace the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was still neer <hi>Madame,</hi> taking the same course to win Love from her as he had done with the <hi>Mareshale, Bussy</hi> carefully obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all the Duke did, to whom the Queen had made a signe to come speak with her, just at the same time that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame</hi> having taken notice of <hi>Bussy</hi>'s curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity, called to him to know the reason.</p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:204334:115"/>
               <p> In the last Assembly at the <hi>Louvre</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, said he, I observed that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> always had his Eies turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and seeing nothing so perfect and accomplished as he, I wisht he might fall in love, for I thought you alone a worthy object of his passion. I had those thoughts when you took him out to dance, I observed his joy when he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your hand, and the blushes that seis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you. In summe, <hi>Madame,</hi> I employed so well my Eyes, that I could not doubt but you might one day love. I know not but I might be deceived, but it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, as if the day approached; this is what I observed, <hi>Madame,</hi> when you took notice of my hearkening to you.</p>
               <p>She begun to laugh at what he had said; you fetch your conjectures a great way off, said she, but I have too much esteem for you, to leave you in an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that I will ever dispose my heart to the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi> To whom then that is worthy of it, can you give it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he, if you refuse it to him? To <hi>Bussy,</hi> interrupted she, inclining her self towards him, when he shall cease to love the <hi>Mareshale.</hi> Ending these words, she rid off, leaving him confused, and not
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:204334:116"/>knowing what to think; how many reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did he make on this adventure. He believed <hi>Madame</hi> had a mind to divertise herself with him, rather then hoped, she had any design of inspiring him with the boldness of making love to her.</p>
               <p>The Chase ended, all returned to <hi>Paris.</hi> In the way, <hi>Bussy</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> that the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Madame</hi> had delivered them from so dangerous a Rival. He received with a good Grace, what they said on that point, not utterly disowning his love to her, and yet not seeming too much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have it believed.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> was at this hunting, and would fain have perswaded the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shale,</hi> that <hi>Bussy</hi> had held some amorous Propositions with <hi>Madame,</hi> but she began to give less Faith to what ever she at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to say against him. He was grown powerful in her heart, his merit, his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous thoughts, and above all the love which had touched her, had made him gain a place in the tendrest receptacle of her Soul, from whence it was very hard to snatch him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bussy</hi> was ignorant what his happiness was, and despaired of being beloved. A
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:204334:116"/>great delight which surprises us, when we least suspect it, is that brings most sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with it. <hi>Bussy</hi> made this pleasant try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, he could not think himself happy, but how joyful was he when he could not doubt it.</p>
               <p>The Court prepared to depart next morning, and the Courtiers took leave of those Ladies did not go the progress. <hi>Bussy</hi> intended not to take his of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reshale,</hi> fearing to offend her by his sight, and by this respectful and prudent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he light upon the secret of making himself be desired not to go without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, he thought not to find her at Madam <hi>de Bonnevals</hi> Lodgings, whom he believed his friend, and therefore would not omit waiting on her, having employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the time he thought necessary in this visit, he rose up to be gone. How will <hi>Bussy</hi> part then without seeing me? said the <hi>Mareshale</hi> to him; he answered, that before he durst not, but now he took what she had said for a Command.</p>
               <p>He failed not to attend the <hi>Mareshale</hi> about two hours after her going from Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> who the better to deceive him, had at his going out, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him of her friendship in a manner,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:204334:117"/>that appeared so full of fair Faith, that he went away well perswaded he had not a better friend then she, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt she would be serviceable to him in his Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bussy</hi> was so quick-sighted as to have observed that the <hi>Mareshale</hi> began hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to purge away her errors of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and with such sweet reflexions, and such kind thoughts he came to her; his Looks were full of Languishing and Submissiveness, and his Words full of Love and Eloquence. He spoke at first of what he felt, of the torments absence would create, and of his fears to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The <hi>Mareshale</hi> answered to all this, or rather her passion answered for her. In the sequel of the discourse she made some complaints, but they were obliging ones; should you permit me, said she, to have the least occasion to reproach you? Could you goe without seeing what you love, is it thus you would perswade your passion? or do you know how to love? better then you Madam, replyed he, you dare not stand the tryal, for then you would find all the knowledge is on my side, and therefore you would save your self that shame; she blusht at this answer
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:204334:117"/>and asked if he went with the King. No Madam, you have affronted me, said he, and being resolved to be revenged, I am not now for the progress: and what revenge can you take of me, replyed she? as I can acknowledge Benefits, so I am sensible of Injuries, and let me advise you that 'tis dangerous making me your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Whatever you can say Madam, said <hi>Bussy,</hi> interrupting her, my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is fixt, and without fearing your threats, I must attempt to make you love me; this enterprise will displease you, and then I at least shall have the delight to have given you some vexation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge your self every day thus upon me, replyed she, I shall know how to give af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front for affront, and then I shall have the pleasure of not having yielded to you in resentment. This discourse gave much relief to <hi>Bussy,</hi> who was before in great disquiet, out of the uncertainty he was in of the <hi>Mareshales</hi> thoughts for him, but never found Lover more kind ones, nor greater hopes of happiness, when <hi>l'Hermit</hi> came to give notice that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> entred.</p>
               <p>His new passion could scarce subsist, his heart lean'd towards what he had so much
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:204334:118"/>loved, and all the glory of <hi>Madames</hi> Beauty could not lessen his grief, that he could not bend the <hi>Mareshales</hi> heart. He came to make the last Tryal of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming it, but <hi>Bussy</hi> having already done it, and having Desert and Love enough to preserve his Conquest, the Duke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood from the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> he was past hope.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> having given him the occasion by her arrival, he took leave. <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> came with her, with design ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to break off the conversation of <hi>Bussy</hi> with the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> or to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all that passed, but she came too late, and <hi>Bussy</hi> retired, unwilling to beget a jealousie in his Mistriss, or hopes in <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teauneuf; Grillon,</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> went home with him to supper. After they were gone, he began to think of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and how blessed a thing it was to be well-beloved; his heart had not been accustomed to such delight, nor could he relish it with moderation, but coming afterwards to examine closer what his good fortune was, he found something wanting, which he reserved till the morrow, to desire his Mistriss to perfect.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:204334:118"/>
               <p> The Court was to lie at <hi>Estampes,</hi> he feigned to begone, and understanding the <hi>Mareshale</hi> was in her chamber, he was brought in by <hi>L'Hermite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What come you hither for? said she, at his entrance, I believed you already gone; and was preparing to rail at you: he was about to answer when one came in to tell her, that Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> desired to see her. <hi>Bussy</hi> desired the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reshale</hi> he might be hid, because he was believed to be gone, and being found there, they would suspect he had a great intelligence with her. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took that care, who thrust him into a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set near the <hi>Mareshales</hi> Bed, whilst she went to meet them, lest they should perceive <hi>Bussy</hi> was with her. She masked her surprize at their arrival, by feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Headach; Madam <hi>de Bonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> proposed remedies for it, but she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused them, and her friend divined not those would have done it. Perhaps she had desired not to be interrupted. <hi>Bussy</hi> was in a flame of Love, and in a fair road, and I doubt not but he would have stood in it. Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> apprehending
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:204334:119"/>the grief less then it was, endeavored to be perswaded, made their visit very long. Love has its impatiencies, judge those of <hi>Bussy.</hi> Hearing easily all that was said in the chamber; he overheard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> ask the <hi>Mareshale</hi> what was a clock, for she must be gone at ten, and reaching to a sounding Watch that hung in the Closet, he made it strike that hour. The <hi>Mareshale</hi> who knew her Watch went right, easily conceived <hi>Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy</hi> had put it forward. In short, Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> and the Duke went and left them a full liberty of entertainment.</p>
               <p>After having given some Orders to <hi>L'Hermite,</hi> she opened the Closet door, and <hi>Bussy</hi> came into her chamber, when immediately a great noise was heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and word brought there was fire, and that the Flames increased: she would have seen her House burn, and her Houshold-stuff, well known to be the most Magnificent of the Kingdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed without the least trouble, but the fear she was in of <hi>Bussy</hi>'s danger, cruelly afflicted her; and notwithstanding the arrival of <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> she would go into the Closet where <hi>L'Hermite</hi> had once more hid him, when the Flames that is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:204334:119"/>from the door made her believe her Lover was consumed. What a loss at the point of being happy, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing <hi>Bussy</hi> for all his Labor and his Love! she swounded, and none but <hi>L'Hermite</hi> at present knew the cause. <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroles,</hi> who was to part next morning, passing by that Street, faw the neighbors run towards her House, and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause, comes directly to her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, where the Fire first took; One whole wing of her House was burnt, in despite of all help could be brought. The <hi>Mareshale</hi> reviv'd from her swound, and he withdrew, the Servants had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired as much as possible the strange disorder caused by the Fire, but the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reshales</hi> Lodgings being quite burnt, they were forced to make ready for her ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chamber. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> caused the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the Closet and Chamber to be searched for <hi>Bussy</hi>'s Body, but all in vain. The <hi>Mareshale</hi> sad and desperate, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding her to take a Torch, would go her self, to see if she could not discover the unhappy remains of a Man she had so dearly loved; but passing out of her Chamber, she rejoyced to find him alive; he told her, that perceiving the Fire took
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:204334:120"/>hold of the Closet, he chose rather to leap into the Garden, then expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to what might have been talked, had he been seen pass through the Chamber, which he could hardly have that way avoided. That being conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the darkness, he waited a time to get away undiscerned, but when he thought he had found the opportunity, feared to be discovered by <hi>Ligneroles</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestiques, hindred him, and made him return back, that the Fire being quell'd and nigh far spent, not knowing how to get out of the House, he sought for <hi>L'Hermites</hi> Chamber, when now he met her. <hi>Bussy</hi> saw her all in Tears, her Hair in disorder, and only in her Night-Gown, but in that negligence she discovered great Beauties, which still inflamed his desires.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> who knew not the accident till it was late, returned to the <hi>Mareshale</hi> assoon as she heard it. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> brought <hi>Bussy</hi> into a Wardrobe belonging to her chamber, and which on the other side, had a door into a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of Pictures, and put him into a great Press, lest Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> should see him. She condoled with the <hi>Mareshale</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:204334:120"/>for her loss, and judging she would have but an ill night of it in that Chamber, pressed her to go lodge with her. This proposition pleased not <hi>Bussy</hi> who heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to it, and he feared her accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the offer, had she had his thoughts she had staid, but not able to withstand the urgent intreaties of Madam <hi>Bonneval,</hi> she consented, and after having whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed something to <hi>L'Hermite,</hi> goes into the Wardrobe, telling Madam <hi>Bonneval</hi> she would immediately return: and <hi>L'Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> who by her Mistress order, gave light but by halfs, being ready to open the Press, saw him just by her; deserve what I have done for you by a kind and faithful passion; I love you, as you may perceive, said she to him, kissing him, and I beg you would not be gone. He was so surprized at the sight and action of the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> that he could not rise, he onely took one of her hands, and squeezing it between his, sighed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> at the same time was coming towards the Wardrobe, but <hi>L'Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> feigning to light better, lifting up the Candle, put it out against the door, she run presently to take another, which was on the Chamber-Table, and the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:204334:121"/>
                  <hi>Mareshale</hi> fearing lest Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> should discover <hi>Bussy,</hi> came to meet her just at the time the Candle was put out, and led her back to her chamber; <hi>L'Hermite</hi> bringing another lighted one. In short, she went to lodge with Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> leaving charge to <hi>L'Hermite</hi> to be careful that <hi>Bussy</hi> might go out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived, which she performed. Assoon as he was gone thence, he caused Horses to be brought, parted from <hi>Paris,</hi> and by six aclock in the morning o'retook the Court at <hi>Estampes.</hi> The <hi>Mareshales</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize at his departure, was so much the greater, because she believed she had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained her thoughts to him in so kind a manner, as could not deserve this Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. How cruelly was she angry at her self, for having been so yielding; she resolved to love him no more, but Love soon made her know, he is not so easily rid off, and that he is a sort of guest not to be driven when one will, from that Heart he has once taken posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of.</p>
               <p>She askes <hi>L'Hermite,</hi> if <hi>Bussy</hi> had said nothing to her when he went, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood he had said nothing, but seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed melancholly, and she guest it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:204334:121"/>by reason of Madam <hi>de Bonnevals</hi> coming, and that not having expected her going to lodge with her, he could not undergo so cruel a disappointment, without being extreamly afflicted.</p>
               <p>I told you that <hi>Bussy</hi> left <hi>Neufville</hi> his trusty friend at <hi>Paris,</hi> he was to believe in Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> and to agree with her in what manner they might bestserve him with his Mistriss in his absence, whom though <hi>Bussy</hi> had offended in the tendrest part of her soul, far from imitating his proceedings; she continued to love him, and forgot not the least duty of a kind and faithful Lover. Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> knew nothing of <hi>Bussys</hi> being hid in the Closet and Wardrobe, but there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets Love keeps only for its self.</p>
               <p>She now begins to put in practice the ingenious design she had contrived to ruine the correspondence between the <hi>Mareshale</hi> and him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neufville</hi> was a Man proper for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, he was young, handsome, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, but he had a Heart of Wax, and by that she believed she might revenge the scorn she thought <hi>Bussy</hi> had put upon her, when he gave <hi>Grillon</hi> that Letter and Bracelet she had sent only to himself.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:204334:122"/>The <hi>Mareshale</hi> who would not give occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to suspect the reasons she had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him, told them, that she remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred him with delight, and that his absence much more troubled her, then ever any Persons did. Some true friends gave this account to <hi>Bussy,</hi> but <hi>Neufvilles</hi> Love contradicted it as well as the Treason of Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> who observing <hi>Neuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villes</hi> joy when he saw the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> and his Heaviness when he parted from her, conceived it easie to make him a Lover, if already he were not. What is in your mind, said she to him, one day, that you doe not love; look upon the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> there is nothing so beautiful, you are an accomplished Person, and have desert e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and why should you be ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to your self; she told him so many other fine things, that he suffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be seduced, and it must be added, that the sweet and obliging carriage of the <hi>Mareshale</hi> compleated his loss by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him: thus he became unfaithful to his friend, but Love was his excuse, and when he undertakes a justification, we are constrained to grant pardon to the most guilty.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:204334:122"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neufville</hi> then forgot all that he ought to the esteem and friendship of <hi>Bussy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that his passion ought to see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond its own satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ligneroles</hi> who stayed a day after his Rival, overtook not the Court till they came to <hi>Orleans,</hi> where a Feavor seized <hi>Chateauneuf.</hi> Its accesses not having been violent, <hi>Monsieur</hi> resolved to go as far as <hi>Blois,</hi> but the next day the distemper doubling, she was constrained to stay.</p>
               <p>Whilst Love is forming these cruel vexations for <hi>Bussy,</hi> Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> entrusts the <hi>Mareshale</hi> with the whole se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of her commerce with <hi>Grillon.</hi> Love had some difficulty to enter her Heart that way, but at last he found a passage; her anger against <hi>Bussy</hi> assisted, and the diligence and constancy of <hi>Grillon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the rest. How stand things, said the <hi>Mareshale</hi> to her; does he know you love him? I think he has no reason to doubt it, answered Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> I have writ to him, in a manner suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explaining my thoughts, and as we seldom forget things done for what we love, I believe I remember that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be thus.</p>

               <p> No, doubtless he shall not be so, if his happiness depends on me, pursued she, returning again her Letter, his Desert and Love have made a great progress in my Heart, and if I continue in this mind, I am perswaded there will be many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lovers more to be pittied then he; what do we signify if we love not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Love there is no solid Pleasure, and without that of what use is Life? we are soon tired with the constraints of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, and by that we may find how cruel the Laws are to us, reducing us to extract our shame from the same Center whence Men draw subjects of Esteem and Glory; but do you know what we ought to do? raise our selves above these sorts of Laws, and Love, since nature has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us Hearts tender and sensible: That Sage-Mother would not have let us be born with such strong inclinations of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, unless she had designed us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite with Love Mens Love to us? let us then follow the bent of our own Hearts, and believe that that Virtue which has so many pains and troubles for its guard, is only an endowment which Women unprovided of allurements of the Body, or charms of the Mind have maliciously
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:204334:124"/>invented, to revenge the Scorn Nature has thrown on them, but we who have thanks to return to her, may tread in more pleasant paths, and since Love in account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the greatest Virtues, is it not so always to do virtuously, so follow what it inspires.</p>
               <p>This is, doubtless, most singular Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, said the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> but who is it will begin the practice of it; there have some been found in all times, replyed Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> and you and I should do very prudently in following these Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes.</p>
               <p>'Twas thus, she concluded, the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of her passion.

                  <hi>Bussy</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> led a sad life at <hi>Blois,</hi> and the destiny of the happiest was so averse, that he believed himself most to be pittied and lamented.

Ligneroles</hi> who walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alone, and was some what near them, seeing a Letter in <hi>Bussy</hi>'s hands, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it came from the <hi>Mareshale;</hi> If I could hate you, said he, drawing towards him, I should not be so unhappy, and perhaps the pleasure of revenging my self on a Rival that triumphs over me, would help me to support with less grief, the cruelties fo the <hi>Mareshale.</hi> There was, said <hi>Bussy,</hi> but one way, wherein I desired to be Master; I hoped all from my Love, and from her I love, but you have deprived me of the only good, could make me happy, by telling me my happiness makes you despair; you that are loved, you that know it, and to whom it has not only been told in my presence, but
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:204334:125"/>you have likewise received a favour which was only due to my love, alas, 'tis of that cruel favour I complain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> I am sensible it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for you, I was not used to be so treated, and had I had my choice, should rather have been content with usual and known rigors, then a moments kindness received from chance, and not from the heart of the <hi>Mareshale.</hi> Hitherto, said <hi>Bussy,</hi> interrupting, we have lived rather like Friends then Rivals, let us continue to do so; <hi>Grillon</hi> is not to be suspected, we may freely speak our thoughts before him. To show you I approve what you say, replyed <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> I am about to tell you that not being able to resolve on my departure without having some privacy with the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> I went to kiss her hands that evening the fire took in her Lodgings. That accident so affrighted her, that she swounded, but I suspected not the true cause of it, till an hour after, I made a show of being gone, and hid my self. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> came to search among the ruines of the Chamber, and I thought I heard her name you. I guess'd it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, but you might be stayed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in the Lady <hi>Mareshales</hi> house, though
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:204334:125"/>you were believed to be gone. Alas, I was but too certain of it, some time after I saw come forth the <hi>Mareshale</hi> with <hi>L'Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,</hi> who told her there was no doubt to be made but you perished in the Flames of the Closet; her Tears affected me, and I was just about to discover my self when you appeared, and seeking a place to hide my self, turned back into a Chamber, and sate me down neer a Press. What could I think of your return, and of the kindness of the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> when she came up to me? Ah <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> said <hi>Bussy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, tell me not that I wish I had never known: then he related to him all had happened with her; and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his thoughts concerning <hi>Grillons</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, prayed him to show the Character, but <hi>Ligneroles</hi> would not see it, <hi>Bussy</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving assured him, that it was not from the <hi>Mareshale;</hi> having thus cleared their suspitions, they parted with such expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Esteem and Friendship, that <hi>Grillon</hi> was amazed to think how Rivals could live in such good intelligence, but these were no common Men.</p>
               <p>'Twas now Bathing-time. <hi>Bussy</hi> who was prescribed it, went every night; so did the King and most part of the Court.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:204334:126"/>He scarce knew how to swim, but trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his little cunning, ventured out of his depth, and the stream carried him away; he strove against it, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to regain the shore, but all his striving was in vain; in the end he grew weaker and weaker, breath and motion failed him, and he was ready to sink to the bottom, when a Man swimming with skill and strength, div'd so luckily after him, that in a moment he rose again holding <hi>Bussy.</hi> Every one cryed out assoon as they perceived the danger, but 'twas <hi>Ligneroles</hi> outstript all that would have saved him, and repaid <hi>Bussy</hi> the succor he had once given him. He was carried home, having scarce any sence, and 'twas <hi>Grillon</hi> told him how <hi>Ligneroles</hi> had saved him; he came to him soon after, and what they said, was worthy of what they had done the one for the other. The Court had then resolved to depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two days for <hi>Borgueil,</hi> thought <hi>Bussy</hi> was not in a condition to goe within those two days, yet he would have followed it, but <hi>Ligneroles</hi> and <hi>Grillon</hi> opposed it.</p>
               <p>His Grief was not so great to hinder the thinking of his Love; The <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shale</hi> was innocent, he had offended her
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:204334:126"/>in coming away against her Orders, and without telling the cause, and had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writ to Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> nor to <hi>Neufville,</hi> he resolved to go assoon as he was recovered, and repair his fault with so much service, that she should lose the memory of it.</p>
               <p>With his hopes in a short time to see the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> there grew up a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly he could not suppress; <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was the cause of it, his Merits, his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Thoughts, and the greatness of his Sould; all troubled him; not that he had not a Rival he might hate, but that he had a friend, whom he was not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to serve and make happy. These sad thoughts were his entertainers one mornig, when <hi>Grillon</hi> came back to <hi>Blois,</hi> and told him, <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was killed as he was Hunting, and that within five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces of the King. The grief he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at his death is not to be imagined; he would have risen, and returned to the Court, made open complaints, and thrown out reproches and threats, but what would they have done? are the Great abliged to give an account of their action? or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees it not with their interest and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to punish Pride and Insolence? The
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:204334:127"/>King would doubtless have chastis'd this in <hi>Bussy,</hi> had he had the boldness to speak, but <hi>Grillons</hi> good Counsels hindred his going, and on the morrow he went with him towards <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> made use of <hi>Bussy</hi>'s absence, she omitted no occasion of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his carriage and forgetfulness. The <hi>Mareshale</hi> for the most part heard her, but without ansering her, and made her judge by her manner of acting, that she was kind and constant; her cunning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming fruitless on the <hi>Mareshales</hi> part, she attempted to succeed by <hi>Neufvilles,</hi> who assisted but two much with his love; all being fittingly disposed for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign by her contrived, she sends an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press to <hi>Grillon</hi> with Letters which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Orleans,</hi> after <hi>Ligneroles</hi> death was known at <hi>Paris;</hi> at which the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shale</hi> was very lively afflicted, but had the satisfaction to know that she could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone grieve his death, whom all the world lamented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bussy</hi> received a Letter by <hi>Grillon</hi> from Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> which gave him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the infidelity of the <hi>Mareshale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had made <hi>Grillon</hi> read it, what shall I do, said he? this unlooked for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:204334:127"/>over-whelms me, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I am, I know not what to resolve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grillon</hi> seemed at first as troubled as he, but at length counselled him to make hast to <hi>Paris,</hi> and above all things convince himself of the matter. <hi>Bussy</hi> approved <hi>Grillons</hi> advice, and sent back the Express empty: Being come to <hi>Paris,</hi> Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> who was content with <hi>Grillons</hi> love, received him like a lover she hated not, and he appeared not unworthy her reception. However, though she gave him a thousand testimonies of her trust and kindness, yet she never let him know either her anger or design of revenge on <hi>Bussy;</hi> she spoke of him with esteem, she seemed earnest to serve him, and it was she had advised him of his Mistress trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. We are less sensible of any affront, then that committed against our love. That offence is most cruel, and he that receives it without deserving it, has strange griefs to undergo. In the midst of all these perplexities his love still sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted; and the inclinations of his heart told him sufficiently, that he must still love, though he knew himself forsaken. Then thinking of his unknown Rival, who had snatched from him what had
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:204334:128"/>cost him so much to seek after, fain would he have found out who this happy man should be, but would never have guest <hi>Neufville,</hi> whom he believed his friend, tell he was disabused the next morning, when Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> made <hi>Grillon</hi> tell him, she desired to speak with him. He came at the hour apointed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out stopping at the unnecessary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this interview, I will onely tell you, that she hid <hi>Bussy,</hi> and that soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Neufville</hi> entred, he had a Black Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Suit, Embroidered with Silk of the same, and between space and space might be seen double <hi>L L</hi> in Embroidery of Pearls. <hi>Bussy</hi> at first sight, guest not what those Cifers meant, but he soon found out they were the <hi>Mareshales,</hi> who was of the House of <hi>Lustrac.</hi> She was not long ere she came, and Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> feigning to order her head tire at the Glass, <hi>Bussy</hi> over-heard the <hi>Mareshale</hi> say to <hi>Neufville,</hi> I fear least you undertake to please me, you must succeed in it; your manners are so obliging, you are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and complaisant, and have so much estimable merit, that I fear I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not resist it. Change your procedure, it is too winning, and know that I will not
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:204334:128"/>be affected. These words were pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a delicate mouth, and the fairest eyes in the World glanced favorably on <hi>Neufville,</hi> and <hi>Bussy</hi> believed all this due onely to his love. Have no care nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance for me, continued she, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me before all other Ladies, nor shall I be so weak to love you for it. How happy was <hi>Neufville?</hi> And how desperate grew <hi>Bussy?</hi> He was in the mind to come forth and upbraid the perfidiousness of his Friend and Mistress; but knowing that it is love always makes reproaches and complaints, he withdrew, without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the remainder of their discourse, which he believed he could not quietly listen to. The <hi>Mareshale</hi> knew not of his return, no more then did <hi>Neufville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About twenty paces from the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shales, Bussy</hi> met <hi>Chateauneuf,</hi> who desirous to know some news from the Court, and to tell him that <hi>Neufville</hi> was his Rival, carried him to the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> whither he had designed to go. Whilst he walked two turns with her, he gave her an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of all she desired to know, and told her so respectively, that he would never love, that she had not the power to complain of a Man she could not hate.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:204334:129"/>In vain would she have disswaded him from loving the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> he remained constant, though he thought himself not obliged to do so.</p>
               <p>As soon as <hi>Neufville</hi> was parted from Madam <hi>de Bonnevals</hi> House, the <hi>Mareshale</hi> and she came to the <hi>Tuilleries;</hi> they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> at a great distance, and the nigher they drew, the more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> obliged the <hi>Mareshale</hi> to observe, that the man was with her did much resemble <hi>Bussy.</hi> She granted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblence, but could hardly believe she saw him, till <hi>Bussy</hi> and <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> turned towards them; the <hi>Mareshale</hi> blushed at the sight of her lover, he passed by her with much respect, and could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear looking aftger her; but he spoke not, and continued his walk with <hi>Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> whose design was to increase the <hi>Mareshales</hi> grief, put her in mind how she would not believe her, when she had formerly told her <hi>Bussy</hi> loved <hi>Chateauneuf.</hi> Ingrateful Man, said she to her, do you see in what manner he treats you; after all this, can you love him? to be in <hi>Paris</hi> without seeing you, and publickly sacrifice your love at the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:204334:129"/>feet of your Rival. Alass, said she, I feel all you can instil into me, but let me suffer and complain, I have no need of your Counsels, and will onely follow the dictates of my own heart. <hi>Bussy</hi> at his return home, told <hi>Grillon</hi> all he had seen and heard at Madam <hi>de Bonnevals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So great a cause of despair in so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant a Passion, the Treason of the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shale,</hi> and the death of <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplexed him, and created sufferings he could hardly undergo; sometimes he was resolved to love no more, but to seek in a quiet Retreat, the Remedy of so many Griefs. <hi>Grillon</hi> told him, that was to yield the <hi>Mareshale</hi> to <hi>Neufville,</hi> and that he ought to make her return, either for glory or for loves sake, but he was too incensed to follow this advice.</p>
               <p>Some days after, the Court arrived at <hi>Paris</hi> with the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who joyned it at what time it was at <hi>Bloys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ties of Friendship and Interest which had formerly been between the late King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the <hi>Mareshale de St. Andre</hi> had made her haveâª a great esteem for his Person after his death; she had preserved for the <hi>Mareshale,</hi> the same thoughts she had had for her Husband,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:204334:130"/>she Commanded her to see her often, and had no cause to blame her neglects, for that she seldom was from that Queen, but shared in all her divertisements and all her pleasures.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Medices</hi> mortally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her; she knew that <hi>Jean</hi> of <hi>Albret</hi> had remonstrated to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> that he might be chosen Head of that Faction divided <hi>France,</hi> if he knew how to make use of the occasion of taking the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into his hands. If this counsel had been executed with as much boldness as was given with judgement, <hi>Catherine de Medices</hi> had been no longer Mistriss of affairs; she could not live without ruling; but the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> being too mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and suffering himself to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the passion he had for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiselle de Roy,</hi> who was gained by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine de Medices,</hi> he yielded to her what he could not keep. This was the true foundation of that hate, ended not but with the death of <hi>Jean</hi> of <hi>Albret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bussy</hi> was gone to <hi>Chantilly</hi> to visit the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> then returned from <hi>England,</hi> whither he had been sent to hinder Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from giving assistance to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> by proposing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:204334:130"/>a Match with the Duke <hi>D'Alanzon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap> Bussy</hi> staid there two days, during which came the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> under pretence of seeing his fine House, but indeed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him in the interests of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the better to oppose the hatred and Authority of <hi>Katherine,</hi> who in the ruines of the greatest Men of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would not spare the <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s, whom she ever hated, both because of their uprightness, and because they would not abase themselves, to depend direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on her power.</p>
               <p>The Duke civilly received the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> but would not enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Treaty with her, though some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore not afterwards to give other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations to the conference he had with this Queen; and had not he prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remained at <hi>Chantilly</hi> during the King of <hi>Navarr's</hi> Wedding, he had been pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly enveloped on that dismal <hi>St. Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomews</hi> day, which cost <hi>France</hi> so much blood.</p>
               <p>The Duke treated her with all the Magnificence she could expect from a great King. The <hi>Mareshale</hi> was with her, still fair, but Languishing and negligent of her self. <hi>Catherine de Medices</hi> not able
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:204334:131"/>to suffer the Imperious humour, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Courage, and the Constancy of <hi>Jeane d'Albret,</hi> and her hatred making her take cruel resolutions, she soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter put them in execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bussy</hi>'s Merits were well known, though he had not yet that great repute he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gained; There were then few men of <hi>France</hi> had so much Wit, Valour, or good Mien as he: The Duke <hi>de Montmorency</hi> presented him to the Queen, she received him so kindly that he was compelled to stay at <hi>Chantilly,</hi> though he were resolved to return to <hi>Paris;</hi> besides the entreaties of the Duke, and the sight of his Mistress abating his desire of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so soon, her the easier consented to stay.</p>
               <p>There was in <hi>Chantilly</hi> a Hall and a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set of Armes, whither the Constable <hi>Anne de Montmorency</hi> had caused to be brought from all Europe, what could most worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embellish them with what ever was rich or rare. Above all these things was in esteem a Scimitar set with Diamonds and Emeralds, which the Grand Signor <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> had sent him, together with a Hanger of Dagger all adorned with Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies; The Queen, curious to see all the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:204334:131"/>several Rooms and Magnificent Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which adorned them, passed into this Hall of Armes, and thence into the Closet, where she was showed that Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thought beyond all vallue, both for the Stones which enriched it, and for its workmanship, which added to its beauty and Ornament.</p>
               <p>After it had been in the Queens and some other hands, the <hi>Mareshale</hi> would see it, and having sufficiently admired it, <hi>Bussy</hi> not being far from her, having observed his stand, she went towards him, and drawing out the Dagger, and setting it with a threatning look to his brest, <hi>To what use,</hi> said she, <hi>ought this to be destin'd: To pierce the most faithless of all hearts,</hi> said he, taking the point and turning it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Mareshale:</hi> This Anser surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed her, and she expected not such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, who could not believe she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it. <hi>Ah Bussy</hi> (replyed she in a doleful accent) <hi>there was never a more faithlessâ then yours, Madam</hi> (said he, interrupting her) They were entring into a Discourse had not been soon finish'd, but the Queen going out of the Closet called the <hi>Mareshale</hi> who accompanyed her</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> was not at <hi>Chantilly;</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:204334:132"/>the <hi>Mareshale</hi> had intreated her to go, and <hi>Grillon</hi> had desired her to stay at <hi>Paris;</hi> thus the Friend was refused, and the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had his request. Was not this very just? they could never before converse with so much Love as they had a desire to do. <hi>Grillon</hi> now passed one part of the day with her, the Lady was tender, in short, they said a thousand things were never told. This entertainment being on their own private account, and they being discreet Lovers, and that passed could never be know; but, it may be judged they treated of nothing less then indifferency, and the curious have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that they received often these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, and that if Love had not been mixed with them, they had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so much delight in talking without witnesses.</p>
               <p>Was not Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> too hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py? she was beloved by one of the honestest men of <hi>France;</hi> she had by her cunning betray'd her Friend, made <hi>Bussy</hi> unhappy in stead of doing him Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as she had promised; she fears not the penalties, treason and perfidiousness deserve; she triumphs o're the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the <hi>Mareshale</hi> and <hi>Bussy,</hi> and when
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:204334:132"/>she is with <hi>Grillon</hi> forgets all the World, the better to think of her Love.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mareshale</hi> and <hi>Bussy</hi> found often at <hi>Chantilly</hi> opportunities of talking; but the <hi>Mareshales</hi> fierceness, and <hi>Bussyes</hi> shame and anger to be forsaken, hindred them from uttering what they even died with a desire of speaking. Thus each had their grief and affliction. <hi>Bussy,</hi> that to find the <hi>Mareshale</hi> more lovely, since he believed her false; The <hi>Mareshale,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in <hi>Bussy</hi> a sadness which had very much changed his countenance.</p>
               <p>The Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> returned on the morrow to <hi>Paris,</hi> but <hi>Bussy</hi> staid yet one day with the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he returned to Court: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came every day more and more in Love, and the beauty of the <hi>Mareshale</hi> made him forget the infidelity he thought her guilty of.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> continued still see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lady <hi>Mareshale,</hi> that is to say de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> told her judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it was not well received, and she was silent. <hi>Bussy</hi> seldome saw Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> she complained to <hi>Grillon</hi> that he might tell him, but he had no more an inclination towards her; he
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:204334:133"/>looked upon her as the cause of her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune without suspecting her Treason, and he could have wished never to have heard the person he loved pronounce words in favour of another; but, the thing was done, he had seen, he had heard, Can he any longer doubt?</p>
               <p>So many cause of sorrow in a passion so tenderly preserved, tormented him beyond a power of enduring; so that he was often in the mind to quit utterly his love, and silently retreat from the World.</p>
               <p>The Soul of the <hi>Mareshale</hi> was tossed with no less violent storms, she was loth to lose <hi>Bussy,</hi> and she gave sufficient as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances of it one evening that she found him at the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi>'s. She was resolved to know if he yet loved her, and made use of an ingenuous feigned device to discover his thoughts. <hi>Will</hi> Bussy <hi>refuse to serve me</hi> (said she.) <hi>I should</hi> (said he) <hi>but I cannnot, I have loved you too well. Ah 'tis not that which I desire,</hi> (replyed she interrupting him) <hi>come to me to morrow and you shall know what I have to say.</hi> She had time to say no more by reason of the arrival of Madam, who beginning to fancy some interest in <hi>Bussy,</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:204334:133"/>observed nicely all actions. On the morrow goinng towards the <hi>Mareshales,</hi> he passed by Madam <hi>de Bonnevals,</hi> where he saw <hi>Neufville</hi> enter; <hi>L'Hermite</hi> had order to make <hi>Bussy</hi> stay, she told him his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss dined at Madam <hi>de Bonnevals,</hi> and that she would return immediatedly.</p>
               <p>He was about to go and surprize the <hi>Mareshale</hi> and <hi>Neufville,</hi> and to load them with a thousand reproaches; but <hi>L'Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> who understood the most part of his melancholy hindred his going out: In short, the <hi>Mareshale</hi> soon returned, she would not see <hi>Neufville,</hi> but had left him in the hands of Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> who too officiously pressed her to hear what he would say.</p>
               <p>Being then alone in her Chamber with <hi>Bussy; Though all treary of love be for ever ended between us</hi> (said she) <hi>yet I have so great an esteem for you as to aske your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, Will you give it me? Bussy</hi> promised it, and she proceeded thus. <hi>Since I have lost all hopes of being beloved by you, I think it may be permitted me to engage in another violent passion which may last all my life, my heart whispers me in favour of</hi> Neufville, <hi>he is worthy of love, he loves me, What do you counsel me? To hearken to all that your
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:204334:134"/>heart dictates Madam</hi> (reply'd <hi>Bussy</hi>) <hi>and to give your self wholly to</hi> Neufville. <hi>But if I love him</hi> (reply'd she) <hi>if I have given him markes of it, and if I do all I can to perswade him that no one can be more beloved than I do him, Will you have no regret for what you lose. What matter whether I am unhappy or desperate</hi> (reply'd he) <hi>you my love, you may be happy, and you may have the pleasure never more to remember</hi> Bussy: <hi>follow, follow your own thoughts Madam, and never think of those cruel torments you make me undergo. Ah Ingrateful Man,</hi> (said the <hi>Mareshale</hi>) <hi>Will you forsake me then? you that have made me so sensible, Can you Counsel me to give my self to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? You have done it already</hi> (said <hi>Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,</hi> interrupting her and sighing) <hi>and I have known but too well how dearly you love</hi> Neufville. <hi>Is it possible that you can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid me in the least</hi> (reply'd she) <hi>you who went hence for the progress in despite of that kindness of mine to request your stay? Ah</hi> Ligneroles (cry'd Bussy) <hi>How happy were you at that time, and how did I envy the delights you then enjoyed?</hi> He told the <hi>Mareshale</hi> in what manner she had been deceiv'd, she blusht at what she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood from <hi>Bussy,</hi> and the confusion
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:204334:134"/>she appeared in made her yet seem fairer.</p>
               <p>In sum, he told her he could no longer doubt her being false, that he saw her at Madam <hi>Bonnevals</hi> with <hi>Neufville,</hi> and heard her say to him a thousand kind and obliging thing. The <hi>Mareshale</hi> fell a Laughing at this discourse, <hi>Bussy</hi> grew an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and would have been gone, when <hi>Neufville</hi> entred the room, whatever <hi>L'Hermite</hi> could do to hinder him, and though the <hi>Mareshale</hi> had forbid his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; He looked pale, and grief and repentance seemed lively represented in his Countenance: Having demanded only the favour of Audience from the <hi>Mareshale</hi> and <hi>Bussy,</hi> it was granted him, and he spoke thus. <hi>Had I not been assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pressed forward to become so guilty, I had never betrayed either the trust or friendship of</hi> Bussy, <hi>or have dared to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute my Love; but, Madam, will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, 'twas Madam</hi> de Bonneval <hi>who counselled me to love you, and to tell you so, thence had my crime its spring; your inchanting carriage, your charming features, and in short all your Beauties brought it into a Stream.</hi> The <hi>Mareshale</hi> who had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> could scarce
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:204334:135"/>believe this perfidiousness; but <hi>Bussy</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pul'd out of his pocket a Letter which she had writ for his return, she could no longer be doubtful of her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, after having read her words.</p>

He understood as well as the <hi>Mareshale</hi> that he had unhappily contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to make the Treason succeed, and that Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> ahd managed all things so well, that any other as well as he would have believed her the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful woman living. <hi>Neufville</hi> heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:204334:136"/>and could not but be amazed to hear how farr Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> had carry'd her lies and treachery, when the <hi>Mareshale</hi> prayed him to let <hi>Bussy</hi> know how she had finish'd that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, of which as he had told her, he had heard the beginning. <hi>Imagine</hi> (said he) <hi>what pleasure I had to hear such kind and charming words pronounced in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for, Who had ever the like said to them? I hoped, and I dare say I believed I was beloved; but, How great was my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair? when, after having acknowledged I was in Love. Ingrateful and most perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious man that you are</hi> (said she) <hi>going away from me; Is it thus that you serve,</hi> Bussy? <hi>Love will not permit me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> (said I) <hi>and I obey his commands. Let me never see you more</hi> (said she inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting me) <hi>It begets a horrour in me to behold such unworthy proceedings in a man of Honour.</hi> At these words she turned to reproach Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> and I withdrew in confusion and despair. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this cruel adventure Madam,</hi> (proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Neufville</hi>) <hi>Repentance for having offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, and done so great an injury to</hi> Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syes <hi>friendship, threw me into such deep af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that could I but tell one part of it,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:204334:136"/>you would possibly have the generosity to pardon me. I came to Madam</hi> Bonnevals <hi>with intent to beg it, you avoided seeing or speaking with me, and I am come hither to tell you all this. 'Tis my fault</hi> (said <hi>Bussy,</hi> interrupting him) <hi>I ought not to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested you to take care of my concernes. I might easily have understood it, because what I feel in seeing you Madam</hi> (said he, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards her with a look full of love and kindness) <hi>must be likewise felt by others; Could</hi> Neufville <hi>answer otherwise then he did, when you spoke so kindly, let us forget his fault, and lament his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; for my part I will never spy out in him any other qualities than those of a Friend, without ever remembring that he has been my rival, and that he may yet be so.</hi> The <hi>Mareshale</hi> yielded to what <hi>Bussy</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; his mind forgave <hi>Neufville,</hi> and permitted him to visit her: At this, one came for him from the Queen of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> to whom <hi>Byron</hi> gave a Treat at the <hi>Arsenal.</hi> And <hi>Bussy</hi> and <hi>Neufville</hi> went together to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after to the <hi>Arsenal,</hi> where Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> saw plainly that the <hi>Mareshale</hi> had discovered her Treacheries, as well by a biting reproach she made her as by
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:204334:137"/>the good intelligence she observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Bussy</hi> and <hi>Neufville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She easily allayed this misfortune with <hi>Grillons</hi> love, and that remedy seeming to her very sweet and very pleasant, she took good care to apply it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bussy</hi> was now free from all Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, Trouble and Rivalship: He was in Love, he was Beloved; What could he more desire? One great delight he yet wanted, which his Love made him hope for, and which he resolved to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. On the other side, the <hi>Mareshale</hi> had retrieved her Lover, she loved him, and those that Love can refuse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>During the Collation they spoke a thousand things by looks, which their hearts understood; but, this is not enough for true Lovers, there are yet greater pleasures; they had both the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and the same desires, and they were both perswaded they should find an infinite joy in their first Entertainment, and that then they should find a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the so many griefs they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by Suspitions, Absence, Anger, and supposed Infidelities: They wanted but opportunity to make them happy; but,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:204334:137"/>this happy opportunity came, and 'twas Love that brought it.</p>
               <p>'Twas about this time <hi>Madame</hi> was to marry the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and nothing wanted but the arrival of a dispensation to compleat the affair. The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> loved her, but she answered not his Love again, and <hi>Bussy</hi> was beloved without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. He still received some favourable glance from that Princess; she blusht when ever she saw him, and he observed she delighted to converse with him. He knew himself in love, and doubted not her capable to be one day as much, he often shun'd her glances, and as often avoided her presence. Those that love truly, act thus, They are neither pleased, nor desire any person but that they love. And 'twas this made <hi>Bussy</hi> design to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise the <hi>Marashale</hi> in her chamber, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting her have notice. She was im a charming negligence, <hi>Bussy</hi> saw her, and <hi>Bussy</hi> was in love, and alone. Whence comes it, said she, That I have such a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness on my Spirit, and that all the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my Heart are so favourable to you? 'Tis because you love me Madam, replyed he, and that you could not see me have so much love without following me in so
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:204334:138"/>fair a path. There is your question de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, proceeded he, casting at her glances full of Love and Eloquence, which so well express what the Tongue is not able to utter.</p>
               <p>But I have another more amorous question to ask you, 'tis for your Wits, your Heart, and your Experience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve such difficulties, and the decision you shall give, is so important, that on it depends our happiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bussy</hi>'s Question to the Lady <hi>Mareshale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which I would know from you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is; Whether Love, that ingenious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer of the most voluptuous Delights, has nothing beyond Looks and Words. Some Pleasures and Transports which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Thoughts I am in, that it consists nhot only in the Sight and Discourse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Mareshale</hi> blusht at the question he would have her decide, but when her blushing and confusion were suppressed by what she inwardly felt, she made this answer.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:204334:138"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beyond Looks and Words to to use your own terms, I find a confused mixture of impress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Pleasure and Love. It is made up of all these â I know not well how to decide your question,</hi> proceeded she; <hi>My Heart ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learnt, what it has now told you: but I had it from a friend of mine, to whom all the delicacy of this passion was a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Virtue, and not from my self, who am less knowing and experienced then she.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Madam, said <hi>Bussy,</hi> interrupting her, <hi>Since your self know not whether the decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you have made, be just, let us essay by a sweet Tryal of our desires to find out a truth we cannot doubt of:</hi> he ended these words with a kiss, she made at first some resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, with design only to enflame his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; but in the end, fearing to offend his kindness, she attempted to give <hi>Bussy</hi> an amorous and ready revenge for his kisses, and that she might not appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, she returned them with usury, and neither the one nor the other would have the last kiss. The <hi>Mareshales</hi> Eyes were more sweet and languishing then usual, and seemed to invite <hi>Bussy</hi> to treat of the most endearing mysteries of <hi>Love,</hi> In this very moment her chastity began to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:204334:139"/>yield to the violences of her Lovers pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but alas! can any one believe the cruel destiny of this amiable Person. Her Face was on a suddain painted with a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal colour, <hi>Bussy</hi> perceived it, and called <hi>L'Hermite</hi> to her assistance, but all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies could be applyed were in vain, she died iwthin an hour after in <hi>Bussy</hi>'s Arms. Her death was diversly spoken of, but when within three days after happened that of the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Florentine Gloves were suspected, and in the clearing those suspitions, it was found that the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> had given a pair of those Gloves to the <hi>Mareshale.</hi> In so dismal an adventure <hi>Bussy</hi> could not leave the Body of the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shale,</hi> he lamented in so feeling a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that his sorrow seemed almost as griev ous as the death of the <hi>Mareshale.</hi> He had lost the fairest Person in <hi>France,</hi> just at the point of being happy, his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair was violent and lasting, but yet he died not; what he did we may hereafter tell you.</p>
